This could either be a setting available within the Admin panel UI or at the file-system level in a configuration file. This is particularly useful where Redmine is used as a Help Desk platform where it may be important to relax specific criteria for accepting email (e.g., accept an email from a locked account, but from "anonymous").\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.',

        description: 'Hi,\r\n\r\nI have been using redmine since last 2 years. Redmine solves a lot of problems in a very organized manner so I thought contribution to this community would be a value addition for me. \r\n\r\nThe term \'notes\' in the edit section does provide me a beautiful functionality of entering my queries related to development. But somehow this term does not signify what the user wants to highlight.\r\nThe term \'notes\' is being used where the user wants to highlight any specific point but since the functionality also serves us with a feedback loop for the \'Author\' a change in the term is necessary. Will it be right to use \'Feedback\' or \'Feeds\' as the term instead of \'notes\'.\r\nAlso if I was a beta tester this point would definitely be highlighted. There is a possibility I may be wrong. The issue is debatable. Suggestions are appreciated.',

        description: 'h3. Preface\r\n\r\nThe imports controller was obviously built to be used for more than just issue imports. But since Redmine currently only supports issue imports, there are now some places, where assumptions about the issue import are hard-coded.\r\n\r\nThere are some plugins out there, which add other kinds of CSV imports to Redmine, but none of them seems to use the imports controller. I assume, it\'s because of the shortcomings mentioned above. I wanted to improve this situation, so I decided to build a time entry importer and - along the way - generalize the imports controller so that it\'s able to handle more than just issues.\r\n\r\nh3. Preparations\r\n\r\nThe first patch attached extracts the issue related view parts into partials which are determined by convention. They are all prefixed with the imported model name, i.e. @_issues@. \r\n\r\nThe issue related model parts are moved to the import model. Those are, e.g. the proper menu item, the authorization or the layout. Strictly speaking they should be located on the controller level, but I did not want to build sub classes of the imports controller for each and every kind of import.\r\n\r\nh3. Adding the time entry import\r\n\r\nThe second patch attached adds the time entry import. It\'s using the newly introduced extension points to fill in the blanks. To provide a way for the user to find the new import, I\'ve added the @timelog/_sidebar@ partial, similar to the one for issues. This new sidebar partial is now used in the timelog views and it contains a link to the import.\r\n\r\n*Note:* within said partial, I\'ve mis/re-used an i18n key @label_time_entries_visibility_all@ since it was providing the desired text in German and English. I did not want to introduce a new key based on the existing one, since that would have probably caused major merge problems. If desired, I may of course do that anyway.\r\n\r\nh3. Closing notes\r\n\r\nThe second patch may of course also become a plugin. The main point of this patch (series) was it, to allow plugins to reuse the existing plugin infrastructure. Without the first patch though, a plugin author would need copy most of the views and functionality of the imports class, which is undesirable (at least for the plugin author).\r\n\r\nThank you for considering these patches.',

        description: 'As described in #25799, it can be tedious to reference other issues of the same import in the CSV document. When the document to import was created manually, the order of issues influences the position of rows and therefore the values of parent relations might need to change during the import.\r\n\r\nThis problem was not only reported in #25799, but also requested by multiple Planio customers.\r\n\r\nThe proposed patch tries to simplify this use case. It adds a configuration option "Unique ID". When assigning columns of the imported document, the user may select this unique ID column. If so, it will be assumed, that references to other rows will use the unique ID instead of the row position.\r\n\r\nN.B.: If that reference starts with a @#@, it\'s still interpreted as existing Redmine ticket ID. Consequently it\'s not supported to have a unique ID column with values, starting with @#@-s.\r\n\r\n_This issue is in conflict with #28198. If interested, I\'ll gladly provide a patch for both features at once._',

        description: 'As promised in #22701, I now would like to propose a patch, which adds handling of issue relations to the CSV importer.\r\n\r\nh3. Usage\r\n\r\nThe attached patch extends the import configuration view with a new block, so that users may select a column for each relation type. The parent issue field also moved to the new block, since it\'s conceptually related.\r\n\r\nWithin the CSV file the columns may define multiple relations of the same type, each separated with @,@. Related issues follow the same rules as parent issues. A string preceded with a @#@ is supposed to be an existing issue. Without the @#@ it\'s supposed to be another row within the import file. For _follows_ and _precedes_ relations an additional delay may be present, e.g. @#12 3d@ specifying a relation to issue @#12@ and a delay of 3 days.\r\n\r\nh3. Technical notes\r\n\r\nSince issue relations may only be created when the issue was already saved, I\'ve added a second step to the import. Additionally to @build_object@, which needs to be implemented by @Import@ sub classes, there\'s also a @extend_object@ method now. This is used by the @IssueImporter@ to save the relations after the issue was already saved successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Additional considerations\r\n\r\nInitially, I wanted to build the import, so that issue relations exported from Redmine could be imported directly. But the format that\'s used by the exporter was designed for humans, not so much for computers. Most importantly, to parse this format we would need to grep for the localized relation names, which might even change between versions of Redmine. Therefore I settled for the proposed approach of having separate columns for each relation type.',

This would help users to know if a status change makes the issue closer to completion:\r\n\r\nNew (->) Doing\r\nDoing (->o) Done\r\nDoing (<-) New\r\n\r\nThe icon should be shown in dropdowns in the issue menus (edit and context).\r\nIn Admin > Workflow, clicking in a status change should cycle through the icons.\r\nRole conflicts (forward in one role, backward in another) should use the undefined icon.',

We have: Role A, Role B\r\n- Set 1 new Tracker: Tracker A\r\n- Set 3 new statuses: Status A, Status B, Status C\r\n\r\n- Define a Workflow for Role A, Tracker A with the following: *All transitions are checked between Status A, Status B*. Transitions to and from Status C are NOT checked.\r\n- Define a Workflow for Role B, Tracker A with the following: *All transitions are checked between Status A, Status B, Status C*.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorrect case:\r\n\r\n- As an admin, or as a user with Role A AND Role B, go to the New issues form, and for tracker, choose "Tracker A"\r\n\r\n- In the "Status" dropdown, Status A, Status B and Status C are shown\r\n\r\nIncorrect case:\r\n\r\n- As an admin, remove the add/edit issues permission for Role B\r\n\r\n- As an admin, or as a user with Role A AND Role B, go to the New issues form, and for tracker, choose "Tracker A"\r\n\r\nObserved:\r\n- In the "Status" dropdown, *Status A, Status B and Status C are shown*\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n- In the "Status" dropdown, *Status A and Status B are shown*\r\n\r\n\r\nReasons why this happens:\r\n- When we uncheck the permission add/edit issues from a Role, the WorkflowRules are kept in base.\r\n- In the method used to get the new statuses allowed, we don\'t filter out roles which are not allowed to add/edit issues, hence still reading the WorkflowRules above. \r\n\r\nSee details below\r\n\r\nDetails: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/redmine/redmine/blob/e8bc1dbaa80dd714254da9c19e4ffaae4fbf9736/app/models/issue.rb#L988\r\nhttps://github.com/redmine/redmine/blob/d105365e06eddfdd66406c56b5f45dba2fda6769/app/models/issue_status.rb#L66\r\n\r\n\r\nOptions to solve the problem:\r\n- Delete the WorkflowRules associated with the role when add/edit issues permission is unchecked (maybe too destructive)\r\n- Always filter (see links above) on roles for which the method @consider_workflow?@ returns true (seems the simplest)',

Epic\r\n2. User Story\r\n3. Task\r\n4. Bug\r\n\r\nAfter a few months, we observed a lot of mistakes made by our users: Epics having subtasks another Epics, Tasks having subtasks User Stories and so on.\r\nThen we decide to create this plugin to restrict the subtasks to specific relations: Epics only with User Story trackers as subtasks, User Story only with Task and Bug trackers as subtasks, etc..\r\n\r\n_Current settings_\r\nThe current workflow settings allows you to configure only if a tracker can/must be or not a subtasks (by making the field Parent task Read only, Required or Optional).\r\n\r\nBecause I find this feature very useful and a missing piece from the already powerful workflow settings, I\'ve started work to a patch that implements this feature in the following way (different by the implementation from the plugin which has his own issues):\r\n\r\n!subtasks.png!\r\nAccording to the settings from the image, the Feature tracker can have as subtasks only issues with Bug and Support trackers.\r\n \r\nPlease let me know what you think about this feature and the proposed implementation.',

Plus, if a module is delayed in version planning, then it could indicate that it delays a product release in product Roadmap. In the module Roadmap it could display in what products the module is bundled and whether it delays anything. \'Product\' and \'Module\' are plain projects in Redmine, but have different semantics and are used by different teams, planning and development, respectively.',

The transaction was active for about 24 hours and was blocking some of our housekeeping jobs and we had to kill it.

Default filters is that I see tickets (jobs) for all our customers, even the jobs not yet assigned to customer (so I cant use filter Customer=any because it will list only non-empty values).\r\nBut each time I need to select specific customer, I have to go to Add filer / Customer (very very long list of attributes) / Then select customer.\r\nIt would be really awesome, if the filter can be already in saved query as a Customer = All (or somehow) so I can quickly just select value I need to filter and not adding custom filed into filter lists.\r\n\r\nSorry for cumbersome description :)\r\n',

Description\r\n\r\nI always fail to migrate against clean (blank) database on MySQL 5.7 under Redmine4.0 (trunk).\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. Environment\r\n\r\n- MySQL5.7 / Default setup, without any custom configurations\r\n- Redmine trunk (SVN: trunk, Mercurial: default, GitHib: master branch)\r\n- Without plugins\r\n- Database and Redmine under Docker container and VirtualBox VM CentOS7\r\n\r\nh2.

Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n# Install Redmine and MySQL  like above. (Especially, run MySQL5.7 default with settings)\r\n# Create database.yml for mysql.\r\n# Run migration task: rake db:create &&  rake db:migrate\r\n\r\nAt first, migration process proceeds normally, but an error occurs in the middle, at "20150113194759 CreateEmailAddresses”.\r\n\r\nh2. Expected Results & Actual Results\r\n\r\n* Expected: Migration completed successfully\r\n* Result: Failed\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround\r\n\r\nAs error message says, this may caused, "Changed the default null value for timestamps to false".\r\nRef. http://guides.rubyonrails.org/5_0_release_notes.html\r\n\r\nh4. A.

        description: 'Creating a filter to exclude one particular named version (A token "Next version") causes the filter to use the version_id and not the name. If the name is later changed the filter also updates, and therefore removes the exclusion of the desired version.\r\n\r\nh3. Reproduction\r\n\r\n# Create a project with several versions (simulates past versions)\r\n# Create issues for the various versions\r\n# Create a version that is a placeholder for an as yet unknown version ie "Next version"\r\n# Create and save a filter for target *version is not* "Next Version"\r\n# Edit one the the issues so that it is resolved in the "Next Version" (simulates a fix is ready to test)\r\n# Test the saved filter excludes this issue.\r\n# Simulate the next incremental build by renaming the "Next Version" accordingly (done by script/API or set manually)\r\n# Create a new version named "Next Version" (scripted or manual)\r\n# Test the saved filter\r\n\r\nAn example project has been created at the "demo instance":http://demo.redmine.org/projects/target-version-test (subject to link going stale)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected\r\n\r\nThe filter to continue to use the named version ie "Next Version"\r\n\r\nh3. Observed\r\n\r\nThe renamed (actual) version is now excluded. The new version is not used for exclusion by the filter despite having the same name.\r\n\r\nh3. Workflow example\r\n\r\n* Testers report defects and indicate the affected version in a custom field for the purpose. \r\n* Developer addresses the problem and marks the issue as ready to test in the future build in the target version field. \r\n* The build script is run, updates the tracker target version by renaming the placeholder "Next Version" to the actual build number, and creates a new placeholder "Next Version". \r\n* The tester is then able to check the fix in the new version.\r\n\r\nh3. Rationale\r\n\r\nTesters that do not check the target version may incorrectly report the problem not fixed. Creating the filter to exclude the next version can help, but with this defect the filter will now exclude the new version, and include the next (future) version. All saved filters become invalid unless updated individually.\r\n\r\nTesters may be inexperienced in Redmine (public facing, or new to the project)\r\n\r\nThe use of *version is* multiselect is not viable due to the url becoming extremely large and unable to be parsed where there are many versions. (also requires updating with the new actual version)\r\n\r\nThis problem can be worked around by manually editing each saved filter to point to the correct version, or by only setting issues as ready to test once the new version is known or decided. This however is busywork that can easily be avoided via simple automation renaming the placeholder.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\n\r\nFilter to track by version name and not by version_id, or optionally allow either filter types.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis issue is marked as a feature request, but is also a defect that may require an enhancement.\r\n\r\nDefect #26667 appears to be somewhat related.',

If I try the same thing with a different repository with no spaces in the name, it works as I believe it should (can view / diff files).

        subject: 'Send individual notification mails per mail recipient',
        description: 'With this patch series, we are introducing the general concept to send multiple mails per notification event. Specifically, we are sending one mail per recipient user. Each of those mails is rendered in the context of the recipient (i.e. with @User.current@ set to the recipient). The mails can be sent immediately or optionally delayed using ActiveJob.\r\n\r\nThis approach has a couple of advantages over the existing approach of sending a single mail to multiple recipients:\r\n\r\n* We ensure object visibility for the rendered mails in the most generic way. Since each mail is rendered with @User.current@ set to the recipient, all content rendered in the mail (including shown issue attributes, macros and links in rendered textile text, ...) is guaranteed to only be visible to the user without having to ensure this manually for each mail using the same visibility rules as used for the HTML views already.\r\n* The mail will always be sent in the recipients language, even if multiple users with different languages are notified\r\n* There is no risk of the whole notification mail being rejected because of a single invalid recipient address (see #8157, #6829, #8733 and a lot of duplicates)\r\n\r\nIn the long run, it will also allow us to introduce user-specific additional information in the rendered notification, e.g. related issues, links to assign the issue, ...\r\n\r\nWith this new approach, we do have a some challenges which we are trying to address separately:\r\n\r\n* Since each mail is always rendered with an adapted @User.current@, any mail views which expected to use the original @User.current@ need to be adapted. In Redmine core, this only affects the security notifications.\r\n* Depending on the number of recipients for a notification, there might be many rendered mails which can take some time in the request. To ensure a snappy response, we can use ActiveJob to render and send the mails in the background. This can make the @async_*@ delivery methods obsolete.\r\n\r\nh2. Reminder: How mail sending works in plain Rails (and Redmine)\r\n\r\nThis patch series changes how mails are generated and delivered. Let\'s first look at how a mail normally gets generated and delivered in ActionMailer.\r\n\r\n* @mail = Mailer.news_added(news)@ - The user calls a class-method of the Mailer class (a child-class of ActionMailer::Base). This method is usually not implemented in the @Mailer@ class itself. Instead, there is a "@method_missing@":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.2/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/base.rb#L576-L582 method on @ActionMailer::Base@. Here, ActionMailer creates a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object. Which is basically a delegator to an _eventually rendered_ mail object. Now, the mail is not actually rendered here. The @MessageDelivery@ object only collects all arguments it needs to eventually render the mail. This happens implicitly when any method on the mail is accessed (e.g. when the mail is about to be delivered). The @MessageDelivery@ delegator is returned to the user.\r\n\r\nNow that we have the (delegated) mail, we can deliver it with @mail.deliver@. This method used to be the only delivery method. With newer Rails versions, there is (with some variations) @deliver_now@ and @deliver_later@. Redmine usually calls @deliver@ which in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 calls @deliver_now@ currently.\r\n\r\nWhen calling @mail.deliver@, the delegator starts to render the mail:\r\n\r\n* "@MessageDelivery#processed_mailer@":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.3/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/message_delivery.rb#L103-L107 creates a new @Mailer@ instance and calls @process@ on it.\r\n* @Mailer#process(:news_added, news)@ - The @process@ method is part of ActionMailer (and in turn part of the @ActionController@ framework on which ActionMailer is based on). Among things, it calls the specified action, i.e. the instance method.\r\n* @Mailer#news_added(news)@ - This instance method is implemented on the Mailer class and is responsible to render the actual mail message. Here, we set headers, instance variables for the view and basically do the usual controller stuff. With a final call to @mail@, we eventually render a single mail and return a @Mail::Message@ object.\r\n* This returned @Mail::Message@ object is delivered with a call to @Mail::Message#deliver_now@.\r\n\r\nh2. How we hook into this process\r\n\r\nNow, in order to send multiple mails, we hook into this process to render (and deliver) multiple mails. We want to ensure two things:\r\n\r\n* We want to create multiple mails, one per recipient and deliver them all in one go.\r\n* When rendering the mail (i.e. when calling the Mailer\'s instance method), we want to set @User.current@ to the recipient user and set it back to the original value after the rendering is done\r\n\r\nThese two goals are achieved with two specific changes to our Mailer:\r\n\r\nWe introduce a wrapper class called @Mailer::MultiMessage@. Instances of this class wrap multiple @Mail::Message@ objects (or rather @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ objects which delegate to @Mail::Message@ objects). The class provides the same @deliver_*@ methods as the original @Mail::Message@ objects. When calling such a method, we are calling it on each of the wrapped messages. This allows us to use an instance of this class in place of a @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object.\r\n\r\nWe use this class by implementing _class methods_ for each mailer action. These class methods implement the same external interface (i.e. accept the same arguments) as the old instance methods. This ensures that we keep the existing public interface. The class methods fetch the recipient users for the respective object (i.e. the issue, news, comment, ...). We use @Mailer::MultiMessage#for@ to add an @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object for each recipient which eventually renders the mail.\r\n\r\nWhen creating the delegator, we also pass the recipient user to the arguments for the mail rendering. We use this user in the overwritten @Mailer#process@ method to set @User.current@ and their language before actually rendering the message. This convention allows us to keep the interfaces clear: the user is only passed between the class method and @Mailer#process@ but doesn\'t need to be specified on the instance action. Here, it is already set as @User.current@ for each rendered mail.\r\n\r\nWe also extend @Mailer.method_missing@ (on the class) to create a single-mail @Mailer::MultiMessage@ object with the current user in case the class method for an action is not explicitly overwritten. This ensures that our convention of always passing a user to @Mailer#process@ is kept up even if a plugin only adds an instance method (which was valid before).\r\n\r\nh2. What we tried and did not work\r\n\r\nI first attempted to set the current user directly in the action\'s class method. and reset it directly afterwards. That would have made the code much more localized. However, due to the delayed rendering of the mail with the @ActionMailer::MessageDelivery@ object, the mail will be rendered only after we have already reset the current user.\r\n\r\nOne way to work around this would be to introduce @deliver_*@ methods (like the now obsolete @Mailer.deliver_issue_add@ method). However doing so would have changed the intended external interface of our @Mailer@ class and would likely lead to integration pain with all existing Redmine plugins sending mail.\r\n\r\nh2. What we ship\r\n\r\nWe ship three patches here:\r\n\r\n* @0001-Send-individual-emails-for-each-mail-recipient.patch@ - The main implementation including tests.\r\n* @0002-Cleanup-Remove-Issue-each_notification-and-Journal-e.patch@ - Removes unneccessary methods for grouping recipients based on custom field visibility\r\n* @0003-Optional-Ensure-that-ActiveRecord-Base-objects-are-f.patch@ - An optional patch which changes the serialization behavior when sending mails with ActiveJob (e.g. with @Mailer.news_added(news).deliver_later@). By default, Rails serialized the arguments as a globalid (which is basically a reference to the object in the database identified by its ID). If there are concurrent changes to e.g. a newly created issue, this might result in notifications using the new state instead of the original state. With this patch, we serialize the exact attributes of the given objects into the job. Since this also causes nested attributes to be serialized along, care must be taken to avoid reference errors. In general, we should probably try to use mostly immutable state in the database where it is an important consideration that the notification state is exactly shown in the DB.\r\n\r\nh2. Future work\r\n\r\nh3. ActiveJob sending\r\n\r\nIf the general direction of this patch is accepted, it is probably desireable to move the mail sending to ActiveJob completely. This could replace the @async_*@ delivery methods [[EmailConfiguration#Asynchronous-delivery_methods|currently configurable]] in @configuration.yml@. This change can either be hardcoded in source:trunk/config/initializers/10-patches.rb#L160 or made configurable with a setting. I\'ll be glad to provide a patch for this. It would only be a few lines of code.\r\n\r\nBy default, we could use the in-process ActiveJob runner to send mails. More advanced users with a dedicated job worker (e.g. delayed job) can easily switch to that without changes to the Redmine code itself.\r\n\r\nh3. BCC recipients\r\n\r\nSince each user gets their own mail, we can probably remove the setting to send mails with BCC completely. If plugins want to send mails to non-user recipients, we would have to make sure to either set the recipients manually on BCC or group them appropriately. It is not a required setting in Redmine core anymore though.',

        description: 'May be related to #7849 \r\n\r\nSometimes a more complex issues relation is needed as it is available in Redmine. Real life example: we are moving to a new office, so we have a list of renovation related issues, among them 1) Build-up (like internal walls painting) and 2) Air condition split system. The start date of this two issues are not directly related, we can start them independently in parallel. However, the set up of the internal air conditioning unit can only be done after the build-up is finished (the external unit and the link can be installed beforehand). So the relation type needed is "Due date follows": Air condition issue due date follows the build-up issue (its due date as usual) by XX days. \r\n\r\nAs a workaround, I can split the second issue into two "Condition without the setup of the internal unit" and "Setup the internal unit of condition", however, this adds an excessive level of details to the plan (as soon as the conditioning is done by the 3rd party, I do only need the date they will start the setup and finish it).\r\n\r\n',

        description: 'Given the following flow with each of the users using the Firefox browser:\r\n\r\n* User A opens issue 42 (for viewing, the issue edit form is already rendered hidden)\r\n* User B opens issue 42 and changes the version field (or any other select box)\r\n* User A becomes aware of the change (e.g. via notification mails) and soft-reloads the issue view (F5 in Windows)\r\n* User A adds an issue note.\r\n\r\nWith the last update of User A, they inadvertently also update the Version field back to the value it had when User A first loaded the issue in step 1. The cause of this is a peculiarity of how Firefox handles changes on forms with soft reloads. This is described on https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1279253. What happens here is that Firefox ignores the changed @selected@ value on select box and always retains the value it had on first load, even if the value was never actually changed by the user.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this results in unwanted behaviour of the issue form (and possibly all other forms using select boxes like the project or admin settings). If users are not very carefully, they might inadvertently overwrite values. This problem is not really detectable on the server since the values sent by Firefox are valid. Here, it looks like the user just changed the value back.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of tests, it appears that Firefox takes the @name@ attribute of a form tag into account to detect values of existing forms on reload. If the name value changes, firefox doesn\'t take any changed values into account and assumes that the newly loaded form is completely different. The attached patch leverages this behaviour by adding a random @name@ attribute to all rendered forms. For Firefox, this results in no form values being preserved on reload. Since Redmine already asks for confirmation on leave, this isn\'t much of a loss probably.\r\n\r\nThe name attribute does "not appear":https://stackoverflow.com/a/8946369/421705 to be actually used for anything else and is thus save to be used here. Still, we preserve any explicitly set @name@ attribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n',

That could be used in the activity view as well or possibly any other location.\r\n\r\nIn the end what I would like to have is the option to render the tracker combined with the status, so that it gets more human readable. For example:\r\n\r\n Unseen feature #123: bla\r\nOpen Bug #234: bla\r\nClosed Bug #456: bla\r\nImplemented Feature #567: bla\r\n\r\nAs you see the status is the first word, the tracker the second. However, I think in other languages the order should be different, so it needs to be made configurable (or it is hard-coded somewhere).\r\n\r\nSure, the status have to be combinable. Also the Tracker must not be a plural word. \'Needs feedback Features\' sounds a bit cumbersome, but it\'s still okay. If it would be configurable you could still achieve something like \r\n\r\n!/attachments/download/18761/issue-link-sample.png!',

This could be because I need for other plugin to be loaded first.\r\n\r\nThe ideia is to to have each plugin check at the top of init.rb for it\'s requirements and if they are not met to raise Redmine::Plugin::PluginDeferLoadError. This will signal the plugin load logic to try loading this plugin later.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm prevents infinite looping (by direct or indirect circular dependencies) by loading plugins by iterations. In each iteration amount of plugins to load must be lower.\r\n\r\nThe most common check made by plugins can be simplified by using at the top of the init.rb this line:\r\n\r\n<pre><code class="ruby">\r\nRedmine::Plugin.requires_plugin(\'redmine_plugin_name\')\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nRegards',

This step is very boring.\r\n\r\nThe same case occurs if you just got a link in some way. For example link to the file in Dropbox cloud or even some image on site. If you need to attach these files you have to download them to local drive first. Then find them on the local drive and then upload to the redmine.\r\n\r\nWhat about UI changes?

        description: 'In the current implementation, the encoding of exported CSV is fixed for each language and users cannot change it.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is problematic for teams using multiple languages. Suppose the situation that issues in a project are written in Japanese or Chinese (mixed language project; some issue are written in Japanese and some issues are written Chinese). If you want to export those issues to CSV, using UTF-8 as the CSV encoding is only solution to get readable (not garbled) CSV file. But actually the encoding is fixed to CP932 for Japanese users (source:tags/3.3.3/config/locales/ja.yml#L164) and gb18030 for Chinese users (source:tags/3.3.3/config/locales/zh.yml#L147). No one can get CSV file in UTF-8 without modifying source code of Redmine.\r\n\r\nI think the problem can be resolved if users can override general_csv_encoding setting in CSV export options window like the following picture. The encoding in the drop-down list is defaults to general_csv_encoding and users can change to arbitrary encoding. We already have the similar drop-down in CSV import feature.\r\n\r\n!{width: 600px;}.csv-export-options@2x.png!\r\n',

It took me an entire day to get the latest version of Redmine installed on Ubuntu 16. Most people would have given up.\r\n* Team up wit RedmineUp and Redmine plugin devs to make Redmine officially theme-packed, feature-packed, and modern.\r\n\r\nAny chance we could make this happen?

        description: 'To replicate the issue one needs to:\r\n* 1. Create a level 1 issue.  This will be the parent of all other issues.  Let\'s call it Issue #100\r\n* 2. Then create any number greater than 1 subtasks of that parent.  We will create five and say they are issue ID\'s 110, 120, 130, 140, and 150.\r\n* 3. Now under issue ID create a subtask with issue ID 111.  That will work fine.\r\n* Here comes the problem:\r\n* 4. Move 111 to 150 and it will be abandoned.\r\n* 5. Move 111 to 140 and it will say 140 is the parent, but it will actually be placed under 150.\r\n\r\nLooking at the issues table in SQL the problem seems to be that the lft and rgt fields do not increment when adding the new subtask to a new parent that did not have tasks previously.  So, the new task fails over to the next available range of lft rgt bounds.  If there is no parent to that range then the issue is orphaned, otherwise it assigns the issue to the next range available, but not the one that the user desires even though the application will say the tasks is a child of the correct parent.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOur current workaround is as follows using the example from above:\r\nEdit issue 140 or 150 whichever you are working with as follows.  Remove the parent of 100 and set it to blank and save. Then edit issue 111 so that it has no parent and save it.  Go back to issue 140 or 150 and set the parent to 100 and save it.  Then go to issue 111 and assign to either 140 or 150 and it will now work. \r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nEnvironment:\r\n  Redmine version                3.3.0.stable\r\n  Ruby version                   2.1.8-p440 (2015-12-16) [x64-mingw32]\r\n  Rails version                  4.2.6\r\n  Environment                    production\r\n  Database adapter               SQLServer\r\nSCM:\r\n  Filesystem\r\nRedmine plugins:\r\n  redmine_agile                  1.4.1\r\n</pre>\r\n',

The only choice is "Description". Choosing this will show the description full width beneath each row. I found that this is controlled by a variable in the QueryColumn class called @inline. The QueryCustomFieldColumn class extends the QueryColumn class and hard-codes the @inline variable to \'true\'. I would like to be able to "Show" long text custom fields similar to the Description.\r\n\r\nThis would allow, say, a query where "status is \'testing\'" and have the search results show \'Testing steps\' beneath each item. Or, a query where "version is 3.3" and show "Release Notes" beneath each item.\r\n\r\nCurrently when you select "description", the description is shown, but without a label. If you can choose custom fields, then the text would need a label. Such as "Release notes: blah" \r\n\r\nI haven\'t been able to test this against trunk. I wasn\'t able to get a copy of trunk working, so I don\'t know for sure if this was also resolved in addition to #21705.\r\n\r\nI\'ve tried to search thoroughly if this has already been requested or implemented some other way, and I can\'t find anything.

However, after migration we started noticing a few strange problems affecting non-admin users:\r\n* Some trackers are missing from project\'s overview pages and the existing ones have massively reduced issue counts.\r\n* Clicking on "View all issues" on the overview page leads to an empty issues list.\r\n* *However*: clicking on "Issues" on the project\'s navbar leads to correct listings (the only difference seems to be the "?set_filter=1" querystring).\r\n* Following the same pattern: changing the filter leads to empty lists, which then work after clicking on "Issues" on the navbar again (so, again, "?set_filter=1" seems to be the only difference) \r\n* The issues API also delivers empty results as soon as a filter is provided (simply accessing @issues.json@ without a filter shows the appropriate issues)\r\n\r\nThe admin users see everything as it should be, leading me to believe this might be a permission issue, but we double and triple-checked all settings.\r\nWe also cloned the whole redmine instance and removed all plugins to make sure this wasn\'t caused by some monkey-patching of models.\r\n\r\nI couldn\'t find any existing issue mentioning any similar behavior.',

        description: 'I posted this already as a comment in #21074 as this is where this behavior was most certainly introduced but it\'s probably a good idea to open a new issue for this.\r\n\r\n*The problem*\r\n\r\nWhen creating an issue custom field with a default value, the issue details page of issues that have existed before shows the field with this default value. However since the value is not really set in the DB you cannot see it in the issues list, nor can you find any of these issues when searching for it through the filters.\r\n\r\n*Steps to reproduce*\r\n\r\n* Create a new issue.\r\n* Create a new issue custom field (I tried with boolean and text types) with a default value\r\n* look at the previously created issue in issues list (have the custom field displayed) and detail view\r\n* note the different values being shown for the custom field - issue details page shows the configured default, while the issue list shows the field as unset (empty).\r\n* When filtering the issue list for the field\'s value (or simply looking at the database) it turns out that the field is indeed unset (neither filtering for the field being \'yes\' or \'no\' turns up the issue). So clearly the details view is lying about the field\'s true value by replacing _unset_ with the configured default.\r\n\r\n*Desired Behavior*\r\n\r\nImho the default value for unset custom fields (where no corresponding @custom_value@ exists) should only be preset in the edit form, but not when merely showing the issue details. Under all circumstances the details view should be consistent with the issues list in this regard.\r\n\r\nI came up with a patch that checks if there is actually any custom value present in the database for the given field before calling show_value, but it feels more like a workaround than a solution.\r\n\r\nAnother related thing I observed is that, when editing such an issue and setting the custom field\'s value for the first time and to something other than the default, a journal detail is created saying "field xy was changed from <default> to <new value>", though the default was never really set on the field.\r\n\r\nFinally, it might be a useful feature to offer the option of applying the default to all issues (matching tracker / project selection) when saving a custom field with a default set.',

        description: 'h2. Problem with issue numbering\r\n\r\nIt seems like global sequental issue numbering in Redmine makes a lot of people unhappy; they filled a number of feature requests to advocate @PROJECT-01@ scheme support (that\'s Jira-style, I guess), for example: #282, #1926, and #2885.\r\n\r\nThe core developers were always reluctant to adopt such a scheme, because it doesn\'t allow issues to be easily moved between projects. Somebody even wrote "a plugin":http://projects.andriylesyuk.com/project/redmine/issue-id which does exactly that thing (I don\'t know how reliable it is).\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a feature which is worth considering important: the ability to export and import individual projects, as well as transfer them between different Redmine installations (see #3647). Since issue numbers are often put in commit messages, it\'s critical for them to never change after moving to another Redmine instance. Unfortunately, neither global numbering, nor @PROJECT-01@ scheme allows that, since:\r\n\r\n- small global numbers (#1, #2, and so on) are likely to be already taken on the target server;\r\n- people tend to use short project names which are not unlikely to collide.\r\n\r\nh2. Proposed solution\r\n\r\nI think that the only reliable approach to the problem would is to use UUIDs instead of plain numbers. Nobody is surprised about Git\'s SHA-1 revision hashes, why issue numbers are different? Strings like\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nhttp://www.redmine.org/issues/af666b6a-4245-43dc-a42b-f3cd44a58e7c\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nare unlikely to ever clash with another Redmine issue in the world, but still short enough to serve as URLs; they can be easily put into commit messages on a separate line. These UUIDs can be abbreviated when presented to the user on the web interface, while commit messages, comments and wiki sources should always refer to full UUIDs.\r\n\r\nOf course, these IDs are harder to memorize than plain numbers, but they have an inherent beauty of some kind:\r\n\r\n* they are all created equal (most people will find @#42@ better then @#97014@),\r\n* they are not leaving the impression of an imperfection when a project has its issues numbered with large gaps.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this would apparently be a breaking change. Maybe, 4.x could afford it?\r\n\r\nh2. P.S.\r\n\r\nBTW, the UUID approach automatically solves #6642 at the same time.\r\n\r\n',

        description: 'h4. Overview\r\n\r\nWe have a group that manually creates new issues for us. Occasionally they don\'t pay close attention and will create new issues that contain a leading space in the Subject field. This doesn\'t affect basic functionality, but when attempting to sort on the Subject field we get back unexpected results. We finally figured out that the issue is caused by the leading space in the Subject line.\r\n\r\nDoes Redmine intentionally provide support for creating issues with leading spaces or is this a case where it fails to strip leading/trailing spaces from that field when creating new issues? I assume the latter and am filing this report accordingly.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n\r\nh4.

This patch does not attempt to address this problem on a global level. For whatever reason it happens to us quite often in this particular place, causing false alerts in server monitoring.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds an explicit type check to resolve this @params[:query]@ case. As a bonus it makes the following 4 lines where values are taken out of the hash a bit nicer.\r\n\r\nIn general I think it would be preferably to raise an error of the 4xx class in such cases. Are there any plans to make use of Rails\' Strong Parameters feature in the future? I think using these permit / require calls on parameters in controllers would catch such wrong types early and would lead to responses with a more appropriate error code automatically.',

Problem\r\n\r\nAn email was sent in with a pattern like this:\r\n\r\n  [CCDC #123456] RE: 2017 Renewal\r\n\r\nand Redmine proceeded to scrape it. It evidently found the @#123456@ pattern and based on this log message:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n  ^[[1m^[[36mIssue Load (0.6ms)^[[0m  ^[[1mSELECT  `issues`.* FROM `issues` WHERE `issues`.`id` = 104351 LIMIT 1^[[0m\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nthe scraping process attempted to match the new email against an existing ticket. There isn\'t a ticket number 104351 in our system, so presumably the attempt to find and eventually update the existing ticket failed and the scraping process abandoned the attempt. This resulted in the email being moved to the folder we specified for rejected emails.\r\n\r\nWhen we checked the @development.log@ file (we have our @RAILS_ENV@ set to @develoment@ when the scraping script runs), this was the only related error message that we found:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nMessage XYZ can not be processed\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nh4.

The copying is important, because certain projects are used as templates and are only ever copied to speed everything up.\r\n\r\nAttached is a patch which removes the :copy from the require_admin before_filter and instead adds its own method to determine copy access. This method essentially checks if the user can edit the project, and if so grants access to copy. The patch also adds a button to copy a project to the contextual links area when viewing a project if the current user can edit the project.\r\n\r\nButton:\r\n!new-copy-button.png!\r\n\r\nI realize this patch is incomplete (I don\'t use translatable labels for the button and I should ideally create a new permission instead of using "edit") but this is as far as my current knowledge can take me.

Timelog-level custom field inherits possible values from parent issue\r\n\r\nThat can be done by defining special syntax that will be used in definition of Custom field values. \r\nHere is example for custom field values defined at TimeLog-Level:\r\n<pre>\r\nValue1\r\nValue2\r\n##ParentIssue##ReferencedCustomFieldName##\r\n</pre>\r\nIn this example Timelog-level custom field can have multiple values (Value1, Value2), and also inherits  values from custom field named "ReferencedCustomFieldName" at parent issue (indicated by @##ParentIssue##@ indicator).\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Issue-level custom field inherits possible values from parent project\r\n\r\nHere is example of custom field values at Issue-level that are referencing values at parent project:\r\n<pre>\r\nValue3\r\nValue4\r\n##ParentProject##ReferencedCustomFieldName##\r\n</pre>\r\nIn this example Issue-level custom field can have multiple values (Value3, Value4), and also inherits  values from custom field named "ReferencedCustomFieldName" at parent project (indicated by @##ParentProject##@ indicator).\r\n\r\nh3. Issue-level custom field inherits possible values from parent Issue\r\n\r\nAlso you might consider the possibility to inherit values in parent-child related issues, so child issue inhertits selected values from parent issue.\r\nExample:\r\n<pre>\r\nValue5\r\nValue6\r\n##ParentIssue##ReferencedCustomFieldName##\r\n</pre>\r\nIn this example Issue-level custom field can have multiple values (Value5, Value6), and also inherits  values from custom field named "ReferencedCustomFieldName" at parent issue (indicated by @##ParentIssue##@ indicator).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note:*\r\nAbove is only an example how that can be resolved. I suppose that there is a number of other ways to do that in better way. \r\n\r\n',

This should increase accuracy and not affect the existing code - with one exception - the values need to be formatted when displayed (or exported to pdf/csv). But most of that has already been taken care of in #23996 (thank you for that!).\r\n\r\nSo, wouldn\'t it be nice to remove this from the doc:\r\n\r\nbq. 2:05 hours (125 minutes) equals 2.0833333333333335 (est.) in decimal notation\r\n\r\nbq. Due to rounding of the decimal values to two decimals done when showing an accumulated value there can possibly be a tiny difference (as can be seen from the 2:05 example above).\r\n\r\nSorry if this was requested before, I just thought that with #23996 there is a better chance to have it implemented.\r\n\r\nThank you!',

Session expiration not visible when editing issues\r\n\r\nAs some tickets already address redmine\'s behavior when you are _currently_ editing a ticket and get (in the meantime) logged out, this addresses an aditional scenario:\r\n\r\nh3. Problem\r\n\r\nif your session has expired, you can *still click on edit* for a currently shown issue and editing is still possible.\r\nHowever if you hit *save* you will be notified your session has expired.

Desired behavior\r\n\r\nIf your session has expired at least the "edit" function should be blocked and user should get notification on invalid session.

But I think it might be quite helpful to hide the projects I have administrative access to per default and show these on demand.\r\n\r\nMaybe I can assist you on implementing this behaviour but I need a advise where to start from.\r\nOrganisations and companies with a large user base and an elaborated project structure might be very grateful.\r\n\r\nThank a lot in advance!\r\n\r\nJ.

I write embedded code, and I would like to use Redmine to help manage my projects. I have some linux skills, but am a long way from being a guru.\r\n\r\nI installed Redmine on an Ubuntu 16.04, Apache, and MySQL system using "sudo apt-get". For me, this was the easiest, most consistent way to resolve all dependencies and get a basic working system up and running. Trying to resolve all the discrepancies between the various installation instructions in the Guide drove me to madness. I finally found some installation instructions on the Ubuntu help pages that delivered a working system.\r\n\r\nNow that it is installed, I cannot seem to get plugins working. I believe this is due to permissions. Since the system was installed with "sudo apt-get install ..." the files have root permissions. If I try to run the various commands indicated in the various plugin guides I usually get errors regarding permissions. (I am repeating my journey to madness trying to resolve all the unexplained differences) . If I try to run the commands with sudo, I get errors or warnings about running as root. In most cases I end up with a broken system. I have not figured out the magical incantation to install this plugin yet.\r\n\r\nThe feature request I have is to have an Administration page where you could upload the zip file, and it would install the plug-in to the appropriate directory, backup the appropriate files (as needed), run the appropriate commands with the appropriate credentials, and deliver a working system at the end.\r\n\r\nI think this would help make this system a lot more usable to non-ruby developers.',

In other words, the data (workload entries for locked users) is visible in the report, but it is not possible to filter it properly for these particular users.\r\n\r\nIt is suggested to resolve it as follows:\r\n1.

        description: 'h1. Goal\r\n\r\nThe idea is, that you can work on a ticket as a draft, store it in between, assign it and change it, add observers etc. but until you are "really" done setting up this ticket nobody will be bothered by e-mail notifications e.g. In practice thus you can collect all necessary information and put it in the ticket in several steps or re-edit it. When you are finished you change the status to (e.g.) "assigned" and any actions on it will now trigger e-mail notifications (corresponding to the user\'s settings).\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, the administrator when defining the status values and workflow could flag certain status values (like "new") as "draft" thus suppressing e-Mail notifications whenever an issue has this status. Also "activity-entries" should be suppressed as they are not intended/meaningful before having finished entering all details properly for this ticket.\r\n\r\nThis does not relate to "store draft" like #2910, which can be achieved with e.g. a firefox plugin like textarea cache. It is more related to the redmine-silencer plugin and the "silencing" activated automatically depending on status.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think about that.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nImmanuel.',

        description: 'h2. Introduction\r\n\r\nCurrently the hashing algorithm used is: @SHA1@ [0]. \r\nI suggest to use a more secure ( computationally expensive ) algorithm to store the password. Some alternative algorithms to use:\r\n\r\n- @bcrypt@ with reasonable iteration count.\r\n- @scrypt@.\r\n\r\nh2. Drawbacks\r\n\r\nThe only drawback I can think of is the migration of the database to use the new algorithm. I\'m thinking about using this approach to fix this issue:\r\n\r\nLet\'s call the new secure hashing algorithm: @H@.\r\n- The salt will be kept in the database.\r\n- Foreach user in the database, *replace* the hashed password: @SHA1($salt.$plain_password)@ with @H(SHA1($salt.$plain_password)@.\r\n- The algorithm @H(SHA1($salt.$plain_password)@ will be used from now when creating a new users/resetting a new password ...\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. Why is @SHA1@ insecure ?\r\n\r\nWhen I say _insecure_ I\'m not talking about the collision ratio. I\'m referencing that it\'s easy (fast) to compute.\r\nExample: Using hashcat[1] v3.10 with GPU: `R9 290X (+10Mhz) - AMDGPU-pro 16.40`[2], It\'s able to compute:\r\n- 4,102,360,845 @sha1@ hash per second.\r\n- 94,960 @scrypt@ hash per second.\r\n- 12,070 @bcrypt@ hash per second ( cost of 10 iirc ).\r\n\r\nThoughts ?\r\n\r\n[0] https://github.com/redmine/redmine/blob/master/app/models/user.rb#L840\r\n[1] https://hashcat.net/\r\n[2] https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B1S_t1Z0KsqByH3pNkYUM-RCFMu860nlfSsYEqOoqco/edit#gid=1591672380',

        description: 'Currently, Redmine offers the possibility to estimate an issue and track the time spent on that issue using the log time module. \r\n\r\nRegarding  the progress made on an issue, the only possibility is to use the "Done ratio" field, but there are some major disadvantages from our point of view:\r\n1. update action requires multiple clicks\r\n2. is not so accurate because if you calculate the remaining time using the formula "done ratio * estimated time" it means that the remaining time can\'t be greater than estimated time. \r\nHaving the following scenario: \r\n** Issue with estimated time set to 4h\r\n** During the development you discover that more hours (6h for example) are required\r\n\r\nIn order to correctly register the remaining time, you need to change the estimation from 4h to 6h and let the done ratio to 0%. Otherwise, the remaining time will be still 4h. \r\n\r\n3. there is no relation between the log time and the done ratio field\r\n\r\nh2. Attached there are 2 patches:\r\n\r\n*1. 01_add_remaining_hours_field_15945.patch*: \r\n* adds a new core field named "Remaining time" which behave almost like the Estimated time field \r\n* automatically set the remaining time equal with estimated time when the remaining time is null and estimated time > 0.\r\n* automatically set the remaining time to 0h when closing the issue.\r\n\r\n!remaining_time_field.png!\r\n\r\n\r\n*2. update_issue_remaining_time.patch:* the user can decide in the log time form to update or not the issue remaining hours. There are 3 options available:\r\n- [default] adjust automatically: issue remaining time will be decreased with the logged number of hours.\r\n- set to x hours\r\n- do no update remaining time.\r\n\r\n!remaining_time_in_time_log.png!\r\n\r\nIn this way, the issue remaining time can be tracked easily.\r\n\r\nAlso, we have in plan the following improvements: \r\n- a new option for "Done Ratio" field to be calculated using the estimated time and remaining time \r\n- better time tracking details in the version page.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple issues related to this feature:\r\n* [[DoneRatio_issues_overview]] - Section "Requests (and patch) for adding 3rd option "Use the logged and estimated time"\r\n* #22326 (implemented by the first patch) ',

        description: '\r\nMany users of Redmine allow access to at least part of their Redmine installation to anonymous users. For example open source projects allow access to their public issue tracker or organizations might allow anonymous access to their internal knowledge base and help desk.\r\n\r\nMost of the time, these organizations would like to encourage new users to join the community to take a more active role, so it may make sense to think about conversion optimization of Redmine for them. A "conversion" in this case would not be seen in a commercial sense, but in a participatory one: a previously anonymous user which hasn\'t taken an active role in the community has now registered and is able to be more active.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, we at "Planio":https://plan.io/redmine-hosting/ have developed a small series of patches which I\'d like to propose for inclusion into Redmine.\r\n\r\n* *Patch 0001* will introduce a new setting in *Administration* -> *Settings* -> *Authentication* that allows admins to hide non-mandatory user custom fields on the registration form. In conversion optimization theory, users are more likely to sign up for something if the sign up form is reasonably small and not overloaded with questions s/he might not want to answer at this time.\r\n* *Patch 0002* For news articles and forum messages, display the "Add a commment/message" links above the comments/messages if there are more than 3 of them. This is in preparation for the next patch...\r\n* *Patch 0003* shows a small link asking anonymous users to register on: the issue list, individual issues, news articles, forum topics, as well as on the login form. The link will only be shown if the user would be able to perform the current action after registration (i.e. as a non-member) and only if the admin had previously activated this feature via *Administration* -> *Settings* -> *Authentication*.\r\n\r\nI am attaching a few screenshots to illustrate this set of features.\r\n\r\n!issue_list.png!\r\n',

Now, Redmine make a request for each image.\r\n- some of the current custom themes already use icon fonts (Abacus theme, Minelab, PurpleMine2, our custom theme and I think the theme from plan.io).\r\n\r\nWe\'re interested to contribute with a patch that implements the FontAwesome icons, but because there are at least two ways to implement them, we want some feedback before from Redmine contributors and/or users.\r\n\r\n1. *Using i tags*: \r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\n* Is the recommended way on their "official page":http://fontawesome.io/examples/#basic \r\n* We can use all the build-in rules available in the FontAwesome CSS.\r\n\r\nDisadvantages:\r\n* it\'ll be required to add the i elements in views.\r\n\r\n2. *Only from css*\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\n* the views will not be modified\r\n\r\nDisadvantages:\r\n* The build-in rules must be reimplemented in the current  CSS\r\n* The icons will be defined using their unicode. For example, the fa-pencil icon (similar with the current images for icon-edit) has the unicode f040.\r\n\r\nOnly for demo purposes, I\'ve attached a patch that replaces the icons from issue page with font awesome icons (using i tags).

It happens even if there is only 1 issue to export. \r\n\r\nTo reproduce the bug, you can create around 40 custom fields with a random name (30 chars) / format and assign them to a tracker / project. then create an issue with random content in the fields. Then on the issues page, export to pdf with all columns included.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause anyway the pdf would not look nice with such big amount of columns, we could perhaps forbid the export if there are too many columns (lets say > 40) selected in the export. \r\n\r\nThis is what I added to mitigate the error, in app/controllers/issues_controller.rb#index:\r\n\r\n<pre><code class="ruby">\r\nif params[:format] == \'pdf\' && @query.column_names.count > 40\r\n  redirect_to(:back)\r\n  flash[:error] = "Please reduce the amount of columns selected."\r\n  return\r\nend\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nAfter further investigation, I found the problem to be located in lib/redmine/export/pdf.rb, in the RDMMultiCell method. So it may be due to RBPDF...\r\n',

More and more it is important to envelope costs in projects for us.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have possibility for estimate costs and compare them to the real used money.\r\nThings should behave like time management in redmine:\r\n\r\n* estimate costs per ticket\r\n* document real costs per ticket update\r\n* things from subtickets get accumulated in primary ticket\r\n* things get accumulated for project\r\n\r\nThis could be easily achieved using custom fields for "time"-entry. But as far as i see, there is currently no option for custom time-fields to behave like the time itself (accumulate and so on).\r\n\r\nIs it possible to extend the custom time-fields to behave like the "time"-field itself?

        description: 'When a task starts and ends on the same day, it can happen that the bar in the PDF is rendered wrong, i.e. it\'s rendered from the start day to the right end of the page.\r\n\r\nThe problem is in @lib/redmine/helpers/gantt.rb@. When @#pdf_task@ is called, @coords[:bar_end] - coords[:bar_start]@ happens to be 0. The cause for this is the zoom factor applied in @#coordindates@ and the subsequent @#floor@. By adding some @Rails.logger@ statements I got this:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\ncoords[start]: 92/1, zoom: 36/73\r\ncoords[start]: 45\r\ncoords[bar_start]: 92/1, zoom: 36/73\r\ncoords[bar_start]: 45\r\ncoords[end]: 92/1, zoom: 36/73\r\ncoords[end]: 45\r\ncoords[bar_end]: 93/1, zoom: 36/73\r\ncoords[bar_end]: 45\r\n</pre>\r\nEach value shown before/after applying zoom.  While before zoom, the values where 92/93, the became 45/45 afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe attached patch fixes the PDF rendering problem by making sure, the with used in the @RDMCell()@ call is at least 0.',

This can be defined as per development process. This will also allow to add stages such as \'Approval\' Q&A, field-trails, user-acceptance. etc. which currently are not present. \r\n# There can be workflow setup for versions where in issues of certain tracker can be allowed to be added or not depending on the status. For example. after the build-complete stages - bugs can be added but features can\'t be. \r\n# There can be also provision to make custom fields appearance and make it appear/read-only/compulsory etc. Currently there is no such provision.\r\n# The issues can be moved to specific status based on version status. For example, by moving the version from development to QA - it will move all issues under the version to corresponding versions. \r\n# The reverse should also be linked: unless issue satisfy all requirements to change status from x to y it should not allow the version status to change. For example, unless root-cause or testing specific details are filled, issue shouldn\'t be allowed to move to resolve, that should also prevent the corresponding version to move to complete/close status. This will have critical reinforcements of processes. \r\n# Finally, like issues, version status should be allowed to change from specific states to other states only by specific roles. This will reflect huge possibility for software development processes. For example, only QA related people can be allowed to move version from Testing phase to ready phase. only specific people can move version from the scope-freeze to development. \r\n\r\nCustomizable state work-flow model will allow many software development processes mapped exactly how it is followed in the actual processes. \r\n',

        description: '_This is the modified adoption of a suggestion in issue #22941._\r\n\r\nIn the view of a ticket we have the section Subtasks. The user can add (create a new) ticket there, but is not able to link an existing one. This could be optimized with the new "+" menu (see #15880 from where I\'ve got this screenshot):\r\n\r\n!/attachments/download/16100/new-add-button-20160606.png! \r\n\r\nOf course, this would require that the menu items are context dependend, since it makes no sense when the user sees e.g. the Roadmap page and gets a "New subtask" entry (sub task of what?). But it does make sense when the user sees a ticket! So the menu entry could be only visible if the user has entered the ticket view. Since I haven\'t tried 3.3 so far I actually don\'t know if the menu is already context dependent.\r\n\r\nWith this the "Add" link/button (or "New subtask" if #22491 was implemented) could be left as it is, but with the proper meaning that the user just adds an existing ticket as subtask. It would than have the logic as the _Related issues_ "Add" link/button.\r\n\r\nIn short: \r\n# New subtasks will be created with the "+" menu.\r\n# The "+" menu gets dynamic.\r\n# The ticket\'s Subtasks section provides a button to _link_ existing tickets ("Add").\r\n',

        description: 'When "I don\'t want to be notified of changes that I make myself" is checked, it prevents email notifications for issues created and updated by a user to that user.  The feature to prevent notifications is great when using the Web UI, because users instantly know what\'s happening in the system and don\'t necessarily need email notifications confirming their actions. However, when an issue is created or updated via email, there is no visual feedback for the user that confirms their email was processed by Redmine.  Redmine is completely silent and users can only know of changes if they log in and confirm it on the website.  It would be nice if there were an override enabling email confirmations ONLY on issues created or updated over email.  ',

        description: 'Currently image thumbnails are created using shell outs to ImageMagick\'s convert tool.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple reason, why this might need to be changed. I do not want to list them here though, since they are largely fueled by "FUD":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt. Nevertheless, the latest ImageMagick security bug lead us to investigate alternatives to create thumbnails.\r\n\r\nWe came up with the following patch, which uses GD Graphics Library aka gdlib, gdlib2, or gdlib3.\r\n\r\nThe changes \r\n\r\n* remove the newly introduced dependency to mimemagic, since there is no immediate need to verify the mime type of the image anymore.\r\n* use the @local-fastimage_resize@ gem[1] to perform the transformation.\r\n* remove support for BMPs since libgd does not support them in all cases\r\n\r\nPlease note, that this will probably not work on Windows or JRuby, since interaction with libgd is done via its C API in a native c extension of the fastimage_resize gem.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nfn1. "local-fastimage_resize":https://github.com/planio-gmbh/local-fastimage_resize is a fork of "fastimage_resize":https://github.com/sdsykes/fastimage_resize.

The output is something like \r\n\r\n    This is a link&\r\n\r\nI suspect there is a problem during the text escaping because the function ``parse_wiki_links`` in app/helpers/application_helper consider that there is an anchor.

        description: 'Attached you may find a patch, which adds Wiki to ODT export capabilities to Redmine. \r\n\r\nThe export works similar to the PDF export in that it mainly passes the generated HTML export to another library. In case of ODT, this is the @html2odt@ gem, which in turn is based on "xhtml2odt":https://github.com/abompard/xhtml2odt, which uses XSLT to transform HTML to OpenDocument compatible XML. \r\n\r\nThe Redmine integration mainly consists of code to handle image paths and a bit of clean up before passing the HTML to the library.\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nThis change was implemented for a Planio customer, who wanted to use the Wiki to create simple templates, that users should then fill out using MS Word (and friends). We chose to export ODT (instead of DOCX e.g.) since the OpenDocument format is an open standard, the tool support was better and since it is supported by a wide range of word processing applications (MS Word 2010 and later, LibreOffice, OpenOffice, AbiWord, Pages).\r\n\r\nPlease note, that this feature benefits from the change proposed in #22898. Otherwise aligned images within a paragraph cause errors in the export, i.e. the following paragraph is missing from the ODT.',

In this way, the users will have more ways to prioritize the work in a version.\r\n\r\n*Our use case:* We use the versions as sprints (time based) and for each version we plan some issues that the team should implement in the next period. Having this feature available, we\'ll be able the set also the order in which the features should be implemented (issues positioned in the top of the version are the most important).   \r\n\r\nThis mechanism is very used in the modern software development (like scrum, kanban) and is an alternative to the classical planning (with start date, due date and follows/precedes relations) which are great also, but not so easy to use in teams that periodically release issues and the priorities change often.\r\n\r\nA similar implementation like in the #12909 is enough in my opinion and the drag\'n\'drop mechanism should be available only in the roadmap tab and version page. In the future, this feature can be extend also to allow drag\'n\'drop issues from one version to another. ',

        description: 'Following up on #22058, I would like to propose, that also PDF files are shown directly instead of forcing downloads.\r\n\r\nThis applies to two use cases:\r\n\r\nh3. 1. Following a download link\r\n\r\nWhen following a download link, image are sent with @content-disposition: inline@, while all other files are sent with @attachment@. Since the some browsers is able to render PDF files directly (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, IE with Adobe Reader installed) and people are probably used to it, I think that extending this exception to PDF files is a reasonable change. If native PDF rendering within the browser is not supported, then a download will be initiated by the browser anyway.\r\n\r\nh3. 2. Displaying a PDF file in repository browser\r\n\r\nWhen accessing "View" within the file view in the repository browsers, Redmine currently forces a download of the PDF. Instead an iframe could be rendered which displays the PDF within the Redmine UI. Browser support for this use case is similar to No. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe patch series is based on current trunk (r15332) plus the changes of #22482. If desired, I could isolate the changes further, to make them work without #22482.\r\n\r\nh3. @0004-Don-t-force-download-of-PDFs-but-show-in-browser-pre.patch@\r\n\r\nThe change updates @AttachmentsController@ and @RepositoryController@ to send PDF files with @content-disposition: inline@. (See first use case.)\r\n\r\nh3. @0005-Show-pdf-preview-for-repository-files-and-attachment.patch@\r\n\r\nThe change adds @attachments/pdf@ and @common/_pdf@ views to render PDF files in an iframe/object construct. (See second use case.)\r\n\r\nSince we cannot easily know the PDF’s dimensions, the frame size follows the following rules:\r\n\r\n* it is as wide as possible (100%)\r\n* in general it is as high as it is wide\r\n* it is never higher than 80 % of the viewport (80vh), since we want to make sure, that there is always a bit of Redmine UI visible to avoid getting “trapped” within the frame\r\n\r\nUsing a nested object/iframe structure was taken from http://pdfobject.com/static.html',

It would be nice to add a table such as *custom_field_plugins* that would link a custom field to a plugin name (the plugin would be in charge when it adds a custom field to indicate that this custom field is used by this plugin).\r\n\r\nWhen a custom field is linked to a plugin :\r\n* A new column in the *Custom fields* list (below) is added and indicates the name of the plugin (name given in the table custom_field_plugins) :\r\n\r\n!CustomFileds.png!\r\n\r\n* The button !Delete.png! is not present on these lines (to avoid deletion);\r\n\r\nAdvantages : be able to use "Custom fields" features on these fields (changing the name, the default value, the list of values, if it is required or not...).\r\n\r\n!CustomFieldValues.png!\r\n\r\nWe could imagine that the table custom_field_plugins will permit to set the fields of *Custom fields* to be modifiable or not. For example a column name_read_only to 0 will not permit administrators to change the name of the plugin custom field. If the value is 1, the name of the custom field might be modified.

I assigned this role to the "Non-members" users of this project, in the project\'s Members configuration tab.\r\n\r\nAfter doing this, the non-members users are allowed to see each other issues in the Activity and Issues tabs, however when clicking on one of these unallowed issues to see its detail, a 403 error is triggered.\r\n\r\nHere is a video of the situation:\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/7aHFglhjIKo\r\n\r\nI already disabled all other plugins and restarted.

Except, it should also be "Required" when wanting to switch from "Accepted" to "In progress", but setting it as such in the Workflow means allowing them to modify it.\r\n* For now we are giving Sales the permission to change status from "Reviewed" to "In progress", for which we can set the "Approval Number" as a required field, but :\r\n** They tend to forget to switch status after inputting the Approval Number, because it is not intuitive to them (Basically, the "Approval Number" being filled in would be the "condition" for allowing the switch to "In progress")\r\n** Support should be able to pick on its own when to switch status, and start work once it has been approved (but again, not modify the "Approval Number").\r\n\r\nSo here, I suppose I\'m wondering how to do value validation ("Is it empty?", "Does it match a format?") as a restriction to status change, or more simply, how to do a "Required + Read-only" setting.\r\n\r\nI am under the impression it is not possible in vanilla Redmine, so this would be a nice feature to have.',

There\'s a few plugins that implement something similar.

This is basically that plus it\'s stateful now.\r\n\r\nThis patch:\r\n* Adds the relative URL root as a meta property in the head tag\r\n* Adds a simple <a> to the sidebar as collapse/expand button\r\n* Makes the .content a BFC taking the remaining width\r\n* Few lines of javascript to toggle CSS and set a cookie\r\n* Sidebar is hidden by setting its margin-right\r\n* Nice hiding animation using CSS for browsers that support it\r\n* The state of the sidebar is read from the cookie and applied on page load\r\n* Good theming support since it\'s mostly just CSS\r\n\r\nBased on r15095, passes all tests with Ruby 2.1.5. Tested on FF, Chrome, Safari (+ an earlier, stateless version on IE11)\r\n\r\nScreenshot: !collapsible_sidebar.png!',

An user may want this for one issue and don\'t want for other issues.',

This strikes me as odd since the MySQL 5.5 reference manual[1] @utf8mb4@ is a superset of @utf8@:\r\n\r\n> For a supplementary character, utf8 cannot store the character at all, while utf8mb4 requires four bytes to store it. Since utf8 cannot store the character at all, you do not have any supplementary characters in utf8 columns and you need not worry about converting characters or losing data when upgrading utf8 data from older versions of MySQL.\r\n\r\n* Is it safe to upgrade the character set for the database and tables as described on #10772#note-7?\r\n** i.e., will future upgrades be problematic due to a conversion of @utf8@ to @utf8mb4@ set?\r\n\r\n* Should Redmine be expected to filter out invalid characters that do not match the character set of the database storing the data?\r\n\r\n* Should @utf8mb4@ be used at the outset?\r\n** I ask because that\'s not noted in the guide (that I can find).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your time.\r\n\r\nfn1. http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/charset-unicode-utf8mb4.html\r\n',

The content of the file, in PDF or CSV format would contain all fields that could be set with an incoming email, iterating thru all acceptable values for all enumerable fields and giving format/content hints for the rest; it could i.e. read<pre>\r\nField-Spec Value\r\n\r\nProject: project-id\r\nStatus: New\r\nStatus: Assigned\r\nStatus: Feedback\r\nStatus: CustomState\r\nDue Date: <Date: YYY-MM-DD>\r\nStart Date: <Date: YYY-MM-DD>\r\nCustomString: <String: 0-12>\r\nCustomNumber: <Integer: 20-999>\r\n(...)\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nDue to the location of the link the access to that hint would be limited to project admins. For more flexible usage, there could be a setting to place such a link on the project\'s main page, too, whose visibility could be controlled by a role permissions setting.',

However, a lot of issues started appearing with what was actually selectable depending on what status the issue was in.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the screenshots provided, *I do not understand how the current Resolved status can contain the Feedback status*. I _may_ be persuaded into accepting that at least Closed would be visible no matter what status has been set, but the Feedback status, according to the workflow I\'ve now tested with, is wrong. I have tried a lot of different arrangements to see if I could bring order to this, but unfortunately failed every time.\r\n\r\nWhat I have resorted to, temporarily, is to enable any current status to select any other status. I\'d rather see I could use the Workflow functionality as it was intended to use.\r\n\r\nThis is a new installation with the following information:\r\n\r\n* Environment:\r\n** Redmine version                3.1.0.stable\r\n** Ruby version                   2.0.0-p598 (2014-11-13) [x86_64-linux]\r\n** Rails version                  4.2.3\r\n** Environment                    production\r\n** Database adapter               Mysql2\r\n* SCM:\r\n** Subversion                     1.7.14\r\n** Git                            1.8.3.1\r\n** Filesystem                     \r\n* Redmine plugins:\r\n** no plugin installed',

Right now, I cannot get any spent time reports unless I go into each subproject and generate a report, or reopen each subproject to generate a total report.\r\n\r\nI am sure some users do not want to see closed subproject tasks.

        description: 'Originally I wanted to raise a bug about the markdown formatter wrongly interpreting a list sub item as code, because it ignored the double identation instead of single identation for code in lists.\r\n\r\nBut while building a proper example to reproduce the behavior easily I found that the whole list parsing (for both ordered and unordered lists) is borked.\r\n\r\nWhile I would like to be able to provide exact directions to what exactly is wrong here, the more I played around with this, the more confused I got.\r\n\r\nWhat I can tell for almost certain is that blank lines are at the core of this issue. Normally items should be wrapped in <p> tags when seperated by blank lines, but here (at least for unordered list items in ordered list items) instead the current ordered list is interpreted as ended and a new ordered list started.\r\n\r\n_I used the official syntax from https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#list as reference, which describes behavior conflicting with what Redmine produces currently._\r\n\r\n*Example Markup*\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n1.  this is a list item with two child items.\r\n    -  first child\r\n\r\n    -  second child wrongly interpreted as code\r\n1.   another item in the same list.\r\n-  text wrongly interpreted as ordered list item\r\n\r\n1. last item of the ordered list\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n*Expected Output (taken form Marxico)*\r\n\r\n!correct.JPG!\r\n\r\n*Output from Redmine\'s inbuilt Markup Parser*\r\n\r\n!wrong.JPG!\r\n\r\n',

        description: 'Hi,\r\nI hope that this feature is not too complex to implement, and other redmine users should find it useful.\r\n\r\nTo point to idea of extending Redmine with this feature, I have to explain the use case first.\r\n\r\nWe have multiple (almost hundered) projects that share same settings regarding custom fields, roles, ... Those projects have  defined complex workflow, that limits users to change some Custom fields. As you know tweaking workflow is tricky bussines, so we prefer that all projects share same set of custom fields.\r\nRight now we have to track define new custom field that will be reference to contract with customer. Each project should have list of their own contract numbers. One of solutions is to use Category field, but that field is already used for another purpose.\r\nI think that it will be very useful to implement following solution:\r\nIn the phase of creating New Custom Field (List type), it would be nice to have two options for "Possible values":\r\n- Static list of Possible values (1)\r\n- Linked list of Possible values (2)\r\nThose options +should not be+ mutually exclusive. Effective list of possible values is formed as distinct union of Static and Linked list of Possible values.\r\n\r\nFirst (1) one already exists. \r\nSecond (2) should have link to another Custom Field of the same type, but on another entity (Issues, Spent Time and Projects). \r\n\r\nFirst example: \r\nIf creating Custom field of type List for Issues or Spent Time, it would be nice to link to possible values of Custom field (type list) at Owning Project level.\r\n\r\nAnother example:\r\nIf creating Custom field of type List for Projects, it would be nice to link to possible values of Custom field (type list) at Parent Project level.\r\n\r\nIn this way our problem with contract numbers will be solved in the way that each Project have custom field (type list) with valid Contract numbers for that project. Let\'s name it Projects_Contract_IDs. \r\nIssues will have Custom field (type list) named for example Issue_Contract_ID. That Issue_Contract_ID links values to Project level Custom field named Projects_Contract_IDs.\r\nWith this feature, we can manage more similar projects very flexible, simply by changing values for custom fields on Project level. \r\nCustom fields on Subproject level, Issue level and Timelog level simply inherits values from Custom fields from Project level. \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you',

I would also suggest revisiting Feature #11698 to look at ability to set other fields ( assignee ) via the Trigger Keywords.

This seems to have changed in some Ruby on Rails Version. Maybe someone knows how to fix this and could provide a patch I could test? I tried myself, but with litteraly no knowledge about Ruby on Rails programming I failed =P\r\n\r\nI attached the migrate_from_trac.rake with all the patches included.',

I have enabled multiple selections for them and so when I use them in an issue, they look like a scroll-able box with a list of options.\r\nThe box does not behave in a user-friendly way when using Chrome. This applies to Chrome Browser only, Firefox and IE seems to be okay...\r\n\r\nh2. Problem Description:\r\n\r\nThe box itself shows 4 options at a time with a vertical scrollbar to the right. When there are a lot more than 4 available options, you are required to scroll through the list.\r\nCurrently, when you *click on the scrollbar arrows* (up or down) it scrolls through about *2 lines at a time*. This is okay.\r\nOn the other hand, when you use the *mousewheel* to scroll through the list, it looks like it scrolls through about *6 lines at a time*. This is NOT OKAY because it tends to completely skip through 2 of the options and I never see them until I click on the arrows to scroll.\r\n\r\nOn other browsers, the scrollwheel scrolls through 3 lines at a time (the normal default for mouse wheel) as expected, which is Okay.',

E.g. Status available (for this Tracker and this\r\n Project) are labels in the localized language, exactly as displayed in the user interface or\r\n system default language (even with spaces, without quoting).\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIn my Redmine format for dates in interface is DD.MM.YYYY and it obviously not working. Only way now to get this information is search on redmine site that actually gives you the note from contributor in some ticket years ago.\r\n\r\n3) Warning about how important to really know that demanding values for keywords are actually allowed by Redmine, because user won\'t see an error of this kind from production log. Mail_handler just successfully creates an issue with parameters that allowed by Redmine and ignores email body parameters that are not allowed silently.\r\n\r\nFor example if my redmine workflow doesn\'t permits to change assignee while ticket having status "deferred" and if i send email with body like:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nStatus: Deferred\r\nAssigned To: Eduard Gan\r\nStart date: 2015.09.25\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nI\'ll just get the ticket with no assignee and no information from mail_handler about why is that in production log.\r\n\r\nThanks!',

I\'ve created an @is_quota@ field for issues. If this is set to true, the parent\'s total estimated hours don\'t include the estimated hours of the parent itself, like so.\r\n\r\nFor example, when the parent task has an estimate of 100.0 h, with one task having 25 h, the output looks like this:\r\n\r\n*Estimated time:*\t100.00 h (Subtasks: 25.00 h)\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on this? Is the naming correct, or does anyone have a better idea?\r\nIs the formatting okay? The sum of the subtasks could also go below the parent\'s estimated time.\r\n\r\nI\'ll add tests for the feature once it\'s clear that everyone\'s happy and that the patch will actually be applied.\r\n\r\n"Diff on GitHub":https://github.com/zeroseven/redmine/pull/1/files',

Those buttons are added from included javascript files, there currently is no easy way to find out which markup is selected from the js.\r\n\r\nKnowing the markup used in the js would allow setting the correct markup/function for the added buttons directly in the js.\r\n\r\nWhile there are a few other possibilities to achieve this (load different js files from the plugins depending on the selected markup, this adds complexity on the js side either because of duplication, loading 2 files for the markup-specific and common code, and so on).\r\n\r\nThe simplest change we could come up with would be to add a line similar to:\r\n\r\n<pre><code class="ruby">\r\njavascript_tag("var wikiMarkup = \'textile\';") +\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nto source:/tags/3.1.0/lib/redmine/wiki_formatting/textile/helper.rb#L35, the same for markdown.\r\n\r\nIs this something that could be added to Redmine, or how should markup-dependent javascript be handled? Thanks.',

This brings several *important issues* which need to be addressed:\r\n\r\n* Markdown without HTML is not any more Markdown, but rather a very limited flavour\r\n* because it\'s a flavour, it needs to be named differently (according to _John Gruber_)\r\n* users of CKEditor (or similar) can\'t easily migrate\r\n* Redmine is very often deployed on non-public networks and thus using HTML is quite safe\r\n\r\nThe easiest solution would be to introduce 2 formatting options instead of one:\r\n\r\n1. "Markdown (with HTML)"\r\n1. "Markdown (without HTML)"\r\n\r\nAlso, there would need to be two different markup manuals (a modern variant based on side-by-side live preview as on http://agea.github.io/tutorial.md/ might be worth looking at and possibly copying from - it\'s MIT licensed).',

        description: 'I work at a large ICT public company in Brazil and we are using Redmine here.\r\n\r\nAt first it didn\'t become apparent that the workflow tools in Redmine would be limiting in any way. But as we start to build more complex workflows and reutilize roles and tracker names for different projects and teams, we noticed that a workflow being inherent to a specific role and tracker, was making us come with similar names and synonyms to roles and trackers so we could develop new workflows for a different areas in our company. Examples of this are: using lower and uppercase in names, adding numbers, using words in both genders (substantives in portuguese have gender inflexion). Ultimately it became an annoyance, as similar entries would populate various menus across Redmine.\r\n\r\nAlso, the closed state being inherent to a issue status, also made we duplicate entries, bacause in a workflow, some state would close the issue whereas in another workflow, the same state would not.\r\n\r\nI still think workflows should still be inherent to roles and trackers, but projects could have diferent workflow sets to choose from, so that you could still have different projects using the same workflow and at the same time could have different projects using different workflows.\r\n\r\nAlso, the closed state should be inherent to the workflow being used.\r\n\r\nFor a first proposal, I would have another entry in the admin menu for a workspace, workflow set, or workflow space, or whatever the best term is in english. From there, workflows would be part of a workspace and in each project you would select the workspace to use. For migration purposes, all existing and new workflows and projects would be assigned to the default workspace. New subprojects should have selected the same workspace as the parent at creation. There is no inheritance of workspace between projects.\r\n\r\nThe main advantages are:\r\n\r\n* fewer roles created;\r\n* fewer issue statuses created;\r\n* simpler migration between workflows;\r\n* more control over complex infrastructure;\r\n* very low impact on simpler infrastructure.',

        description: 'Dear all,\r\n\r\nI have a feature request for the gantt charting facility. Since I am very used to the agile story concept, I am going to write my request as a user story:\r\n\r\nh2. Story \r\n\r\nAs a user of the redmine software\r\nI would like the gantt charting facility to consider the (remaining) effort estimated as a duration of an issue (if no due date is given)\r\nso that I can use the gantt charting facility to estimate the expected end date of my project.\r\n\r\nh2. Business reason\r\n\r\nWe are thinking very agile. So we do not commit to deadlines, but instead continuously estimate the end date of our projects. Redmine\'s gantt chart works very fine if you connect issues and set due dates. But if you only set "Estimated time" instead of due dates, then the gantt charts treat every issue as a one day task. So setting due dates would be necessary, to maximize the value of the gantt chart. Unfortunately, if you have a very agile project, with lots of new task coming in frequently, you would have to maintain these due dates continuously. This is cumbersome work, and does not create any value.\r\nTherefore we would highly appreciate, if the gantt chart would consider the (remaining) estimated time instead, allowing us not to maintain due dates manually as a must.\r\n\r\nh2. Acceptance criteria\r\n\r\n# It is possible to set a "maximum workload per day" in hours, which gives an indication of how much estimated time of issues can be done on one working day\r\n## the feasible domain of "maximum workload per day" is (0,Inf) hours (consider teams, which can get more than 8h a day done)\r\n## "maximum workload per day" can be maintained in the administration of the project\r\n## "maximum workload per day" can be different per project\r\n# If no due date for an issue is set, then \r\n## the remaining estimated (work) time can be calculated as estimated time minus effort spent (or zero if already negative)\r\n## the (implicit) due date for this issue can be estimated as today plus the remaining estimated (work) time divided by maximum workload per day\r\n## the gantt charting facility considers the (implicit) due date for generating the gantt charts for these issues instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would highly appreciate if you would consider this feature request for the future of redmine. Furthermore I appreciate any feedback on my feature request.\r\n\r\nThanks for building a great software.\r\n\r\nBest regards, \r\nSascha Herrmann',

        description: 'We are a brazillian government agency and we\'ve been using Redmine to control ExpressoBr (groupware) tickets.\r\n\r\nSome time ago, it became difficult to manage the workflow status transitions. In a complex workflow, the table becomes so large it would scroll horizontally and vertically away from the first line and column. Zooming out and filters helped somehow, mainly if the status transition would be nearer the top left. The most recently created statuses would be too far right and down for zoom to help.\r\n\r\nThis patch transforms the administration tables into grids, so the first row and first column are always visible, like in a worksheet. Also, I got rid of the button that selected the whole line or column, because it became completely useless in a large grid, but I think it is easy to put it back.\r\n\r\nRedmine has 5 pages with tables in administration:\r\n* Roles and Permissions > Permission Report\r\n* Trackers > Summary\r\n* Workflow > Summary\r\n* Workflow > Status transitions\r\n* Workflow > Field permissions\r\n\r\nThe grid itself is something like a table, it has four parts: A floating first cell, a first line stuck to the top of the grid, a first row stuck to the left, a body that on scroll, repositions the first row and first line using javascript. The other javascript resizes the width of columns in the grid.',

        description: 'I am using Redmine installed in SUB-URI environment for a long time now I plan to upgrade from 2.5.3 into 3.0.3. So I have started testing it before I upgrade my production environment. Everything looks good only one problem I have recognized.\r\n\r\nWhen I receive an email notification from Redmine 3.0.3 installed in sub-uri environment, the URL contains the SUB-URI part twice\r\nlike this http://server.domain/redmine/redmine/issues/1234#change-12345\r\n\r\nAll of the other URL-s are working properly in my Redmine environment.\r\n\r\nMy general site settings contains only server.domain without the sub-uri part.\r\n\r\nIf I use Redmine 2.5 or 2.6 versions with exactly the same setup everything work as expected.\r\n\r\nI have installed everything with SVN checkout and the suggested building procedure.\r\nAll of the functionality in redmine works perfect only the URLs in email notifications are wrong (SUB-URI part doubled).\r\n\r\nI have checked the app/models/mailer.rb file and I have found an important change compared to earlier versions:\r\n\r\nIn 2.5 and 2.6 it was:\r\n\r\n  def self.default_url_options\r\n    { :host => Setting.host_name, :protocol => Setting.protocol }\r\n  end\r\n\r\nIn 3.0.3 it is:\r\n\r\n  def self.default_url_options\r\n    options = {:protocol => Setting.protocol}\r\n    if Setting.host_name.to_s =~ /\\A(https?\\:\\/\\/)?(.+?)(\\:(\\d+))?(\\/.+)?\\z/i\r\n      host, port, prefix = $2, $4, $5\r\n      options.merge!({\r\n        :host => host, :port => port, :script_name => prefix\r\n      })\r\n    else\r\n      options[:host] = Setting.host_name\r\n    end\r\n    options\r\n  end\r\n\r\nI have changed the :script_name attribute in the 31st line like this:\r\n\r\n\t:script_name => \'\'\r\n\r\nSo the function now looks like:\r\n\r\n  def self.default_url_options\r\n    options = {:protocol => Setting.protocol}\r\n    if Setting.host_name.to_s =~ /\\A(https?\\:\\/\\/)?(.+?)(\\:(\\d+))?(\\/.+)?\\z/i\r\n      host, port, prefix = $2, $4, $5\r\n      options.merge!({\r\n        :host => host, :port => port, :script_name => \'\'\r\n      })\r\n    else\r\n      options[:host] = Setting.host_name\r\n    end\r\n    options\r\n  end\r\n\r\nAnd the problem is solved but I would like to be sure is this solution does not generates other unexpected behaviour.\r\n\r\nMy environment is:\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\n  Redmine version                3.0.3.stable.14377\r\n  Ruby version                   2.0.0-p0 (2013-02-24) [x86_64-linux]\r\n  Rails version                  4.2.3\r\n  Environment                    production\r\n  Database adapter               Mysql2\r\nSCM:\r\n  Subversion                     1.6.9\r\n  Git                            1.7.11.3\r\n  Filesystem\r\nRedmine plugins:\r\n  clipboard_image_paste          1.10\r\n  quick_edit                     0.0.8\r\n  redmine_agile                  1.3.9\r\n  redmine_ckeditor               1.1.0\r\n  redmine_dashboard              2.5.0\r\n  redmine_helpdesk               0.0.12\r\n  redmine_my_page                0.1.5\r\n  redmine_per_project_formatting 0.0.4\r\n  redmine_theme_changer          0.2.0\r\n  redmine_wiki_unc               0.0.3\r\n  redmine_work_time              0.3.0\r\n  redmine_xlsx_format_issue_exporter 0.1.2\r\n\r\nThx. for your help\r\n',

However the alert should only played on the following issue-updates:\r\n* A new issue was created\r\n* An issue is finished\r\n* An already finished issue was returned to in progress\r\n\r\nAre there any possibilities to implement this feature? Maybe there are already some plugins or one of you implements this feature with the aid of the REST-API? \r\nIt would be nice if someone could help us or have any ideas.\r\n\r\nGreetings from Germany\r\n',

        description: 'We have a problem similar to #3413, i.e. if we create tickets via email there a lot of signature images will get Redmine attachments. \r\n*But* the difference is that in our company we use IBM Notes thick and web-clients so \r\n# the signature images and the inline images (e.g. user screenshots that Printscreen and Ctrl+V into email body) in each new email have different names\r\n# there is no way to distinguish the inline images from the signature images by name/size (sometimes useful user screenshot may be less that signature image in size) or other tags in email body\r\n# a similar image that is presented in forwarded email several times has multiple names but similar size and similar binary\r\n\r\nHere they are:\r\n!2015-03-06 10-37-50.png!\r\n!2015-03-06 10-41-03.png!\r\n\r\nI know that there is a way in Redmine to filter attachments by file mask. As you can see it is useless in this case. \r\nAlso we want to leave useful inline images because we can not ask users to do not paste the printscreens into the email body directly and to save at first the screenshot as a file and attach screenshot as file (in that case for the user it is simpler to do not report a bug than to do this:) ). So the patch mail_handler_ignore_inline_attachments_patch in #3413 useless for us too.\r\n\r\nI thought to create a list of ignored attachments (e.g. directory in redmine server with all possible signature images files or file hashes list) and write a patch that will compare binary or hash of each new email attachment with the ignored list. But I\'m a newbie in Ruby and I will appreciate any help.\r\n\r\nI guess that the patch should be in the app/models/mail_handler.rb in accept_attachment? subroutine and should use FileUtils.cmp for comparing. But I have no idea what contained in attachment.decoded and how do I compare it to master copy.',

The @like %keyword%@ query basically does a table scan which can easily take 10+ seconds on a medium database with decent hardware (Amazon EC c3.large - high CPU instance).\r\n\r\nWe tried the "elastic search plugin":https://github.com/Undev/redmine_elasticsearch (it\'s still in early beta) for Redmine but it gave unreliable results and turned out to degrade our user confidence in the search.\r\n\r\n*Solution*\r\n\r\nAfter looking at what other ticketing/issue/case management solutions do, I see many of them include a "past week/month/year" in their search and it usually has a default value of past year or month.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a dropdown to select last week/month/year/all time on the search screen and defaults to last year as shown in attached screen shot.  I was able to use existing translations except for the newly added "label_last_year".  I followed the conventions of the rest of your code base as far as possible.

Maybe i missed some authorization but it actually is working in my prod environnement.',

        description: 'Hi guys\r\n\r\nI\'ve been having an issue where when I go to edit the workflow, the "always" grid at the top does not show the current state, that is, all of the checkboxes are unticked.\r\nIf I tick some of them, and then save, the workflow for the selected tracker and role are updated to *only* the ones i\'ve ticked, that is, the ones that were ticked no longer apply and the status/workflow transitions that were there are gone.\r\n\r\nOf note, I\'m using SQL server.\r\n\r\nI am not really familiar with ruby/activerecord but I am a .net/windows developer, hence the use of sqlserver (our production SQL is replicated for redundancy so I\'d prefer to use this as my dbms)\r\nReviewing the data in the workflow database table, the records are as I\'d expect them to be - with some records having 0 for author and 0 for assignee, and others with the appropriate truthy values in those columns.\r\nUsing a SQL subselect insert, I deleted all of the records where author=0 and assignee=0 then re-inserted them, copying them from where author=1 and observed that this made no difference, that is, the data was not the problem.\r\n\r\nThe schema of the database table shows the author and assignee columns defined as smallint for me, which is not a boolean type in SQL server (this would typically be "bit not null default 0")\r\n\r\nThe activerecord tests for sqlserver (https://github.com/rails-sqlserver/activerecord-sqlserver-adapter/blob/master/test/cases/specific_schema_test_sqlserver.rb) have an explicit test to ensure that smallint is not treated as a boolean ala mysql, but there is no test for tinyint or bit.\r\n\r\nI dumped the contents of the workflows array; defined as follows:\r\n<pre>\r\n@workflows = {}\r\n@workflows[\'always\'] = workflows.select {|w| !w.author && !w.assignee}\r\n@workflows[\'author\'] = workflows.select {|w| w.author}\r\n@workflows[\'assignee\'] = workflows.select {|w| w.assignee}\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nwith the command @<%=@workflows.to_json%>@ and observed that the always array was empty, and the author and assignee arrays contained the records where author and assignee contained falsy values.\r\nIf I change the workflows code to \r\n<pre>\r\n@workflows[\'always\'] = workflows.select {|w| w.author==0 && w.assignee==0}\r\n@workflows[\'author\'] = workflows.select {|w| w.author==1}\r\n@workflows[\'assignee\'] = workflows.select {|w| w.assignee==1}\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThen all works as expected - the always grid has the appropriate tickboxes that I would expect by default\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a boolean/casting issue with sqlserver to me, and may affect other places in the codebase, so I doubt my fix for this one screen is the correct one.\r\n\r\nHere are my enviornment details:\r\n<pre>\r\n@Environment:\r\n  Redmine version                2.6.1.stable\r\n  Ruby version                   1.9.3-p545 (2014-02-24) [x86_64-linux]\r\n  Rails version                  3.2.21\r\n  Environment                    production\r\n  Database adapter               SQLServer\r\nSCM:\r\n  Subversion                     1.8.5\r\n  Mercurial                      2.0.2\r\n  Git                            1.8.5.2\r\n  Filesystem                     \r\nRedmine plugins:\r\n  redmine_inline_attach_screenshot 0.4.6\r\n  redmine_issue_checklist        2.0.5\r\n</pre>',

In Confirmed status I can\'t unassign user because field won\'t show up or Redmine will complain of field being read only.\r\n\r\nI think that not unassigning user looks like a bug, but maybe I\'m unaware of achieving desired result.',

All the others need (serious) work.\r\n\r\nWe need _some way of management_ of the provided (installation) howtos. This can (in its simplest form) be a default type of infobox containing info about the Redmine version, used way of deployment (servers, app. servers, proxies etc.), used Rubies and their managers, etc. Ideally they could have a peer-review signature to optimize their overall quality, but such would require a lot of time.\r\n\r\nTemporarily, we might be able to use a plain, colored table as used in [[Hooks_List]].

The user first has to create an account and go into his account settings to be able to change the language into something else. This should not need to be that complicated.\r\n\r\nAs a solution I suggest a simple dropdown box in the header or footer that displays all installed languages in that install and allows the user to pick one. This setting should be stored in a cookie so that the chosen language can be restored  when that user returns. A lot of websites use this method and it should be easy to implement this into Redmine.',

Improvement\r\n\r\nWe\'d propose to add a custom tag to this matching scheme so each installation can reference tickets in a unique way like this:\r\n\r\n* "@Re: [ACME #88989] [JIRA #1231233312] Bandwidth limit@"\r\n* "@Re: [ACME #12932] Bandwith limit@"\r\n\r\nThe tag should be configurable in the admin interface or similar, the regexp could be something like \r\n<pre><code class="ruby">ISSUE_REPLY_SUBJECT_RE = %r{\\[(?:[^\\]]*(?:${tag})\\s?)?#(\\d+)\\]}i</code></pre> which would allow for "@Re: [ACME #88899]...@" and "@Re: [ACME#88899]...@"',

        description: 'Hello,\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I would like to thank all contributors on this very useful project. \r\n\r\nI\'ve have noticed a couple of issues while attempting to migrate a trac 1.0.1 project to redmine, all related to the wiki migration. \r\n\r\n1. Losing lines that contains "inline {{{...}}}" tags in them, like this ".. some text {{{some highlighted/formated text}}} and so on ...". Those lines would be replaced with "pre" tag in the output. I\'ve modified the script so they remain as is, not pretty but at least we are not losing content.\r\n\r\n2. Images where not converted from "[[Image(abc.jpg)]]" to "!abc.jpg!", which makes for a lot of manual modifications in large wiki.\r\n\r\n3. PageOutline tags were not modified to "{{>toc}}" tags, which also makes for a lot of manual modifications in large wiki.\r\n\r\n4. File attachments were not migrated for issues and wiki pages. \r\n\r\nThanks to "migrate_trac2redmine":https://github.com/evfool/migrate_trac2redmine for the trac 1.0 attachments management code, I\'ve adapted it for Redmine 2.6. \r\n\r\nI have provided a patch file and the whole script, I hope that it\'s OK. The patch would break pre trac 1.0 migration, so maybe that two scripts is the way to go. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDominic',

I could create another account at admin level using my personal email (for password recovery), but don\'t want to mix business with personal...\r\n\r\nPossible implementations:\r\n\r\n# Username append\r\n** @username@ login = normal user mode\r\n** @username-adm@ login = same user but at admin level\r\n# Login addt\'l step\r\n** login as @username@\r\n** check if admin possible for username\r\n** popup box "Login with Admin Rights?"\r\n# Other methods?\r\n\r\n\r\n',

        description: 'I understand that Plugins are the recommended way to customize Redmine\'s functionality, but when business needs call for more drastic changes, another solution is needed. I have a few installations now with conflicting customizations, and including Redmine as a gem and running it as a "Rails Engine":http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Rails/Engine.html would make them easier to maintain - upgrading would involve simply changing the Redmine version number in the Gemfile, then running bundle install and tests.\r\n\r\nI\'m unaware of any existing efforts to allow Redmine to run as an engine. I searched the web as well as this site for information related to this, but was unable to find anything relevant to this topic.\r\n\r\nNeeded features:\r\n* Ability to include Redmine as a gem in Gemfile of a new Rails app with bare Redmine configuration\r\n* Inherit all Redmine functionality (models, controllers, routes, configuration defaults, etc.) in including application\r\n* Extend or modify Redmine functionality by adding or replacing Redmine files in new app\r\n\r\nIdeal features:\r\n* Generators to create some needed files to aid setting up a new Redmine site, such as copying over migrations and template config files\r\n',

        description: 'There\'s useful feature in JIRA which we would like to see in Redmine.\r\n\r\nJIRA allows you to create parent-child relationships between versions. For example, you may wish to group your sprints as milestone versions (e.g. "Version 1 m1", "Version 1 m2", etc) under the version for the major release (e.g. "Version 1"). \r\n\r\nIn JIRA, you can set up the major version as the "parent" version for the milestone versions. This allows you to view and track all of the issues assigned to the milestone releases under the umbrella of the major release.\r\n\r\nAll issues under the child version are considered to be a subset of the parent version. These version hierarchies are useful for managing Releases/Sprints/Teams. For example, if you set \'Version 2\' to be the master of \'Version 2 milestone 1\', then you will be able to view all the issues assigned to \'Version 2 milestone 1\' when you view \'Version 2\' on the Planning Board.',

        description: 'Steps to reproduce: Create a new project. In web interface, go to "Settings" tab, then go to "Activities (time tracking)" tab. Deactivate an activity (let\'s say "Design") by unchecking the checkbox. Click "Save". Then reactivate the activity by re-checking the checkbox. Click "Save".\r\n\r\nAt this point, there is a project-specific activity for the "Design" activity in the Redmine database, in addition to the system-level "Design" activity. So the first question could be: is this a bug? Should the project-specific activity no longer exist when it has been reactivated? For the moment, I\'ll assume that it is reasonable that it continues to exist.\r\n\r\nSo, now I make a request to the REST API to get an enumeration of the time entry activities (GET /enumerations/time_entry_activities.xml). It returns only the system-level time entry activities.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I use the web interface to submit a time entry on the "Design" activity for my project via the web interface, it uses the project-specific ID for the time entry.\r\n\r\nThis inconsistency between the behavior exposed via the REST API and the web interface means that I\'m unable to submit time entries via the REST API for project-specific activities, because the REST API does not give me the IDs of those activities.\r\n\r\nIn order to resolve the bug, I would propose to modify the code that adds time entries in order to converts a system-level time entry activity ID to the corresponding project-specific time entry activity ID if it exists. I\'ve attached a proposed patch.\r\n\r\nFor reference, here is the output of ruby script/about:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nEnvironment:\r\n  Redmine version                2.5.2.devel.13434\r\n  Ruby version                   1.8.7-p352 (2011-06-30) [x86_64-linux]\r\n  Rails version                  3.2.19\r\n  Environment                    production\r\n  Database adapter               PostgreSQL\r\nSCM:\r\n  Subversion                     1.6.11\r\n  Git                            1.7.1\r\n  Filesystem\r\nRedmine plugins:\r\n  no plugin installed\r\n</pre>',

I got locked out ! Fortunately, DigitalOcean VMs have a remote console access that I could use to get out of trouble.\r\n\r\nHere are the changes that propose based on my production setup that has successfully tested in the above mentioned environment:\r\n# No changes should me made to /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf as this file gets overwritten every time fail2ban gets updated. Instead, it is recommended to create or add to a file named /etc/fail2ban/jail.local;\r\n#  The content of the Redmine section in /etc/fail2ban/jail.local should read as follow:\r\n@\r\n[redmine]\r\nenabled  = true\r\nfilter   = redmine\r\nport     = http,https\r\nlogpath  = /srv/redmine/log/production.log\r\nmaxretry = 5\r\nfindtime = 600\r\nbantime = 600\r\n@\r\nThis would have the effect of banning the IP address of a client trying to connect on ports HTTP and HTTPS for 10 minutes,  after it has seen 5 failed login reties within the last 10 minutes. \r\n# The howto contains some explanation about findtime and bantime that is not in line with fail2ban\'s documentation and the result of using the large numbers that are proposed in the howto would not yeld good results.\r\n# Note that on my production setup the default location of Redmine\'s production log is in /srv/redmine/production.log\r\n# A section should be added to explain how to get redmine to add a timestamp in front of each line production.log, and it should read as follow "Add the following to /srv/redmine/config/environment.rb :"\r\n@\r\nclass Logger\r\n def format_message(severity, timestamp, progname, msg)\r\n "#{timestamp} (#{$$}) #{msg}\\n" \r\n end\r\nend\r\n@\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',

But I\'ve reverted a change in the patch to not irritate an unexperienced users.\r\nIf I\'ll find a time to implement error logging in a smart way, then I\'ll add an updated patch to this post.\r\n\r\nSo here is my patch to the migration script:\r\n',

My Second Document\r\np. updated time\r\ndiv. description\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIn this structure, page customizing is not easy and list scroll is heavy if there is so many documents. and someone like me want to see more structured view like:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nh2. Document\r\n` h3. Technical documentation\r\n  | h4. My First Document\r\n  | | p. updated time\r\n  | ` div. description\r\n  ` h4. My Second Document\r\n    | p. updated time\r\n    ` div. description\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nI Think, sometimes table view is more fit to document list and sometimes current Page-like view with indents is more fit for some project. so using div is more flexible for customizing the view per usage.\r\n\r\nAttached patch includes view patch to add hirerachy for document elements and example css for alternate style is for table like inline view.\r\n\r\nplease consider this patch. I will make pull request on github too.',

You just have to add another field that specifies the type of the \'version\'. If the user creates a version he or she has to select in a dropdown the type. Ideally you could add some icons to visualize the versions types e.g. in the roadmap.\r\n\r\nIn a further development this the _version_ types could be made configurable.

        description: 'h3. Problem\r\n\r\nOften in a project, a collection exists of wiki pages which are unrelated to each other. And there is no umbrella page with an overview of these pages. There might not even be a designated start or intro page for the wiki at all. The wiki might just be a collection of unrelated pages containing distinctive topics. So it would be very handy if the entry point (or start page) of a project\'s wiki could be an index of all wiki pages. Preferably sorted alphabetically and displayed hierarchically. This would relieve wiki editors from the task of creating (and maintaining) a start page themselves.\r\n\r\nh3. Possible solution\r\n\r\nActually, such an index already exists. It can be accessed for every project, via projects/project_id/wiki/index. You can also find a link to it in the sidebar of the wiki. However, it is currently not possible to set the start page of the wiki to this index. This should be made possible. Perhaps also make it an option to choose between index by title and index by date.\r\n\r\nh3. Unsatisfying workaround 1: redirect\r\n\r\nYou could create a wiki page and set it as the start page. This page would just display a link to the index. Or add in some javascript (is this possible) which redirects. You would have to do this over and over again for each new project.\r\n\r\nh3. Unsatisfying workaround 2: index of child pages\r\n\r\nYou could create a wiki page and set it as the start page. This page would use a macro to displays its child pages. The major drawback is that all wiki pages would have to be a descendant of this page. Also you would have to manually create this start page over and over again for each new project.

We can browse these repositories through Redmine just fine.  However, when an internal Redmine user tries to checkout a secondary repository using a local "svn checkout" command, they would fail to authenticate against any of these secondary repositories of a given project of which they are a member.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe tracked down the issue and found it to be located in the "Redmine.pm" file, located at\r\n\r\n    /extra/svn/Redmine.pm\r\n\r\nIf we look at Line 246 (http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/repository/entry/trunk/extra/svn/Redmine.pm#L246), we are only gathering repository permission for a project whose identifier matches the repository identifier.  This is bad in at least two cases:\r\n\r\n# If the repository is named something different than the project identifier (such as project identifier is "myproject" but the repository is at "/var/svn/myproj")\r\n# If we have secondary repositories which of course would have a different identifier than the project\'s identifier\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we need to modifiy line 246 to include any _repository_ identifer *or* where the repository\'s _URL_ matches:\r\n\r\n     AND (projects.identifier=?\r\n     OR projects.id IN (SELECT project_id FROM repositories WHERE identifier = ?)\r\n     OR projects.id IN (SELECT project_id FROM repositories WHERE url LIKE \'%/\'||?)\r\n     )\r\n\r\nOf course, we\'ll also need to pass in the project identifier another two times when the Perl string is compiled upon execution, which happens on line 461 (or 464 with the added code above):\r\n\r\n    $sth->execute($redmine_user, $project_id, $project_id, $project_id);\r\n\r\nI hope this is a good solution for anyone having the same issues out there, and hope that this (or an adaptation of this) is included in some future release!\r\n',

        description: 'I\'ve tried to do a google search about that but I wasn\'t able to find anything useful. I don\'t know whether this should be counted as a bug or as a feature.\r\n\r\nMy problem is that I save the tabs in my browser, so when I close my browser and open it again, the last open tabs are displayed. However, Opera *does not* make a GET request to the sites in the tabs but displays the contents as they were before closing the browser (probaly it renders them from its cache).\r\n\r\nAnyway, the redmine site of my company has been configured so that you have to log in before you \r\ncan edit issues. It happens to me quite often that when I start my working day, and start working on the issues I\'ve got, I lose track of the time spending on the individual issues and after working on them, opening and closing new tabs, I come across a tab with an issue of a past session (like the day before).\r\n\r\nHere I\'ve forgotten to press F5 to get a new authenticity token. Then I happily click on _Update_ to update the status of the issue and start editing the issue. After a couple of minutes I click on _Submit_ and get a nasty surprise:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n422\r\n\r\nInvalid form authenticity token.\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIf you go back (by pressing the backspace-key or clicking on the back-button of the browser) then you realize that you\'ve lost everything, since the _Update_-Link executes\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nshowAndScrollTo("update", "issue_notes"); return false;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nand even if you execute it again, the form fields are all empty again :(\r\n\r\n\r\nOn some occasions I\'ve lost more than 30 minutes of typing... that\'s very frustrating, specially when you are in a hurry and need to type everything again.\r\n\r\nSo, wouldn\'t it make more sense that when you click on _Update_ instead of getting the textarea right away, you get first an error message/warning that your csrf token is invalid thus preventing you from wasting you time in the first place?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe version of redmine my company is running\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nEnvironment:\r\n  Redmine version                2.4.1.stable\r\n  Ruby version                   1.9.3-p194 (2012-04-20) [x86_64-linux]\r\n  Rails version                  3.2.15\r\n  Environment                    production\r\n  Database adapter               Mysql2\r\nSCM:\r\n  Subversion                     1.6.17\r\n  Git                            1.7.10.4\r\n  Filesystem                     \r\nRedmine plugins:\r\n  redmine_favorite_projects      1.0.1\r\n  redmine_startpage              0.1.0\r\n  redmine_theme_changer          0.1.0\r\n</pre>',

It\'s also not possible to preview this style of linking in an external Textile-aware editor, so if I\'m away from the Redmine installation (internal network), I can\'t get a rough idea of how the document will look and work.\r\n\r\nAt least the headers can be given shorter links by the (#ID) tag. But there\'s no shortcut for just linking to an anchor appearing on the same page, unless I\'m missing something, so the best it can currently be is this:\r\n\r\n<notextile><pre>\r\nh1(#top).

What if the wiki page gets renamed?\r\n\r\nThere is a syntax in textile for linking to anchors on the current page, but currently doesn\'t work in Redmine:\r\n\r\n<notextile><pre>"Helpful text":#AnchorID</pre></notextile>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis would yield a much simpler same-page linking style, compatible with external Textile editing/previewing (aside from the use of any Redmine-specific macros or links of course)\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n<notextile><pre>\r\nh1(#top).

Otherwise, @Redmine.pm@ won\'t be able to correctly decrypt ciphered LDAP passwords.\r\n\r\nThe modifications don\'t change the currently exposed behavior; without @RedmineDatabaseCipherKey@ being set and/or with an unencrypted database no decryption will be performed, leaving the passwords as stored in the database.\r\n\r\nTwo additional perl modules must be installed to decrypt ciphered passwords: @Crypt::CBC@ and @MIME::Base64@. If these modules are not available for @Redmine.pm@, no decryption will be performed.',

        description: 'I was wondering if it would be possible to modify the search to optionally search parsed wiki sites and not the raw source. This should always be optional (checkbox?) because sometimes it might be necessary to search the pages source and not the parsed output.\r\n\r\n*Background* \r\n\r\nI use macros a lot, like the built-in <pre>{{toc}}</pre> along with others from Plugins that allow me to easily display tickets inside a wiki page.\r\n\r\nMy problem is that using the search, wiki pages that contain those tickets (or mainly Macros) aren\'t found as only the source code is searched. \r\n\r\n*Example wiki source*\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\nh1. Test issue summary\r\n\r\nThis site contains all information [...]\r\n\r\n{{ref_issues(-s=Searchterm)}}\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nLet\'s assume that above wiki page will list 7 tickets (using the _Redmine Wiki Lists plugin_) that all contain "Searchterm" inside their topic. I can find that wiki page only when searching for "Searchterm" but not when I use any other term that is part of those tickets\' topics.\r\n\r\nIf for example a tickets\' topic is "Product Z has major issue with raw input" and I refer to that ticket with the term "Product Z" inide the wiki, I only find the wiki page with that term, but not when I search for "input".\r\nIt would be necessary to parse the wiki sites and then search them to find the term in question.\r\n\r\nI am however afraid that this might lead to serious loading times and even more issues, especially with a bigger wiki since every page has to be parsed. A work-around might be a cache that keeps wiki sites availabe in a parsed state, ready for delivery. And when a page is altered the cache for that site gets renewed.\r\n\r\nThis would also speed up the overall site performance in my opinion.\r\n\r\nAnyone besides me interested in such a feature? Good idea? Bad idea? Why?',

Instead, within the User Custom Field settings, there is a checkbox labelled "Editable", in which, when checked, allows the user to _both_ view and edit the custom field under "My Account". \r\n\r\nAs a side note, there is indeed a checkbox labelled "Visible" under the User Custom Field Settings.

Today I wanted to add support to send emails and I configured GMail correctly (via configuration.yml), sending emails works perfectly now... I\'m not sure if that broke configuration as I literally added few lines to configuration.yml but...\r\n\r\nNow all my users that are not administrators can\'t access their private projects with 403 error message. If project is public everything works fine, also administrators can access the private projects. List of projects by regular members can be seen in /projects URL, also issues are shown in dashboard, but when member wants to go into the project or issue details the error is thrown (excerpt from production.log):\r\n\r\nStarted GET "/projects/xxxxx" for 89.x.y.z at 2014-06-11 11:37:50 +0200\r\nProcessing by ProjectsController#show as HTML\r\n  Parameters: {"id"=>"xxxxx"}\r\n  Current user: j.member (id=2)\r\n  Rendered common/error.html.erb within layouts/base (0.1ms)\r\nFilter chain halted as :authorize rendered or redirected\r\nCompleted 403 Forbidden in 20ms (Views: 10.7ms | ActiveRecord: 1.6ms)\r\nWhat\'s going on?? What this error means? Where I can start digging, as I do not see any clue in this? I changed member roles to allow for everything, but still they get 403... I\'m really desperate as I can\'t find anything in settings that could cause this. Could you please give me a hint what to do to get this working back?\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nI\'ve changed logger to debug and I got some more details:\r\n\r\n  Role Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "roles".* FROM "roles" WHERE "roles"."builtin" = 1 LIMIT 1\r\n  Rendered common/error.html.erb within layouts/base (0.1ms)\r\nIs this a bug in Redmine? Why selecting roles creates an error?\r\n\r\nEdit2:\r\nI\'ve upgraded Redmine to 2.5.1 but the problem is still there. This seems as a bug as I can\'t properly configure this via admin Settings. I gave all privileges to members but still they receive 403 error.\r\n',

        description: 'When quantity q issue-statuses are provisioned and where q is large, the matrix of status-transitions is a square with q+1 entries on each side:  1 header plus q issue-statuses.  The defect is that the header-column should not pan horizontally and the header-row should not scroll vertically; only the q-by-q square of {checkbox, >>} should pan horizontally & scroll vertically, not the entire q+1-by-q+1 square.\r\n\r\nIf A) the header-column were fixed/frozen as non-panning and if B) the header-row were fixed as non-scrolling and if C) only the q non-header columns were panned horizontally and if D) only the q non-header rows were scrolled vertically, then the user would not get lost in the massive q-by-q table of {checkbox, >>}s when panning to the rightmost extreme and scrolling to the bottommost extreme.\r\n\r\nFor reference, most spreadsheets (e.g., Microsoft Excel) have a way of freezing/fixing the header-column(s) from panning horizontally and a way of freezing/fixing the header-row(s) from panning horizontally (e.g., Window > Freeze Panes with the adjustment of which cells are to the left and above the resulting +).  Note however in Redmine, there is strictly only 1 header-column and only 1 header-row, so the functionality is not a free-form choice of possibly-multiple header-columns and of possibly-multiple header-rows, as there may be in general in spreadsheets.  Because of this convenient degeneracy, there would be no such adjustable + in Redmine, as there is for example in Microsoft Excel. ',

What I would like is to a similar type of setting for issue links within the rest of the system, especially with issue notes/comments.\r\n\r\nThe main motivation behind this request is that recently we have converted from Bugzilla and have various comments throughout our system in the following forms:\r\n\r\nbug#123\r\nbug #123\r\nBug 123\r\nBug#123\r\nBug #123\r\nIssue#123\r\n\r\nWhat would be great to see is some way to specify an issue prefix similar how it is done for repository commit messages where I could specify a list like "bug#,bug #,issue#,issue #" and have it cover all of the above cases. This is especially important because I can foresee some variation in how people enter these in comments I would like some control over adjusting how Redmine picks them up.\r\n\r\nIdeally in terms of admin user experience it would be great to just specify a regular expression for the match that contains the issue number as a capture. Having this setting used both for commit messages and issue notes/comments makes a lot of sense to me too instead of having them be configured separately.\r\n\r\nI do also remember digging into the Redmine source code a few years back to see if I could hack my way through customizing Redmine to support our specific desired prefixes but don\'t remember where I got with it or where I was checking. I\'m not a Ruby guy but if somebody could give any pointers on where one could get started I would not mind doing as much as I can to contribute to a possible workaround or feature to support this.\r\n\r\nOne another similar note we have several revision references in the following form.\r\n\r\nRevision: 123\r\nAuthor: somebody\r\n\r\nThe main issue we are interested in is the issue linking as the revision details should eventually come through as linked to the issues once we get that portion of our Redmine configuration figured out. As for the historical comments, we can always go through and parse then and add in the relevant links manually.',

In every issue that we now create we need to cite the wiki page where that feature is documented, and then in the wiki page we need to mention which issues are related with that feature, which is annoying and error-prone.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, it would be great to have "related pages" among wiki pages too.\r\n\r\nEVEN BETTER: an option in which every time I mention an issue or wiki page, the destination issues/pages show automatically which issues/pages cite them.\r\n\r\nIs there any plugin to implement such functionality? Any ideas to get around this?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nTiago',

Here are a few key features of Redmine to keep in mind in relation to this Defect:\r\n\r\n* Parent items inherit the min Start Date from subitems, as well as max End Dates from subitems\r\n* How Precedes and Follows relations work as shown here: [[RedmineIssues]]\r\n\r\nh4. Below you will find the steps to reproduce in which I have tried to describe to the best of my ability. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n# Create 3 Issues in a project (Issue 1, Issue 2, Issue 3)\r\n# Make Issue 1 Parent item of Issue 2\r\n# Add a relation: Issue 3 *precedes* Issue 1\r\n# Test the following: set issue 2 at an earlier start date than issue 3\'s start date -- this should throw an error as expected when you press "submit".\r\n# Now, change Issue 2\'s Start Date back to the original accepted Start Date.\r\n# Clear the Parent Field from Issue 2 and press submit\r\n# Set Issue 2 to an earlier start date than Issue 3 and press submit\r\n# Again Make Issue 1 Parent item of Issue 2 and press submit. -- notice how the invalid start date is accepted here\r\n# You will notice that Issue 1 has had its start date changed to the invalid one as well as it inherits the min start date from its subitem Issue 2.\r\n\r\nFeel free to let me know if you would like me to elaborate on anything/have any questions.',

The version number is linked to http://www.redmine.org/plugins/project_alias where the version information says, that my installed version 0.1.0 is the latest.\r\nHowever, the green tick mark isn\'t added by the javascript.\r\n\r\nThere\'s no error in the firebug console, but I can see that the script only adds the class "found" to the version span: @<span class="icon found">@.\r\n\r\nBut I\'d expect @<span class="icon found icon-checked">@',

We are planning to create at least 3 new trackers called "PBI", "SBI" and "WI" (Product Backlog Item/Sprint Backlog Item/Work Item). The WI won\'t be a real tracker but instead it will be a parent virtual tracker group which includes "Bugs", "Tasks" and maybe as a separate workflow "Tests" etc. This structure covers our needs but there is an essential missing control mechanism which is the ability to tell Redmine which tracker should be followed by which one. I\'m thinking of a workflow-like mechanism which covers the transition rules of trackers. First come the PBI trackers, then they go into sprints as SBI trackers and SBI trackers do include tasks, bugs, tests etc which correspond to WI trackers. There may not be a transition between SBI to WI. Normally SBIs are just an upper group of WIs. So we don\'t just need a workflow functionality for trackers but maybe a hierarchical grouping function, too. But we could also live with it if this wasn\'t supported. It only would change the filter parameters for SBI and WI reports/Gantts etc.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to implement something like that in Redmine or should this be a feature request?',

So please make this possible.\r\n\r\nYou could add two text boxes near to the button \'View differences\'. These get filled with the revisions that are selected by the revision radio buttons. And the values of these boxes are used to show the Diff page. The values may be changed by the user manually. Then it would be possible to view the difference between revisions 678 and 3. You could leave the existing pre-selection for each page as it currently is. The values would be changed to those revisions. But the user has always the chance to change these values.\r\n\r\nI hope you get what I mean. At least I tried to suggest something that could be implemented easily and quickly. This is of course not the best solution (because the user has to remember the values if he browses the history pages), but it is probably better than no solution.',

        description: 'I have a need for limiting access to trackers based on roles. For instance:\r\n- only a Developper or Manager role could report a new "Dev Request" issue but not an "Infra Change"\r\n- but only a Sysadmin or Manager role could report an "Infra Change" issue but not a "Dev Request"\r\n\r\nSo far, there is a plugin ( http://www.redmine.org/plugins/redmine_track_control ) that seemed to fit that need, except it was only constraining the tracker choice via UI, and had a few other problems.\r\n\r\nI made my own fork ( https://github.com/darksoul42/redmine_track_control ) in which I tried fixing them on my own :\r\n- creating a permission symbol based on tracker ID instead of potentially non-ASCII tracker name (this would break since ActiveRecord could not recover symbol names from the database, when they had Japanese in them)\r\n- handling the display of my home-cooked "create_tracker#{id}" as "Create #{name} tracker" with dynamically added translations upon displaying Roles\r\n- actually enforce tracker validity check at every level (override on IssuesController), instead of just making a JavaScript popup alert (still needing an override on Issues views to limit which trackers will be displayed)\r\n\r\nBut I stumbled upon the following problem :\r\n- Basically, I am overriding IssuesController and more specifically, build_new_issue_from_params and update_issue_from_params. In order to do stuff properly in regard to handling custom fields (which require the tracker be set beforehand), this would require me to completely rewrite the whole method, just to change this one line in the middle, with quite the ugly code block :\r\n<pre><code="diff">\r\n-    @issue.tracker ||= @project.trackers.find((params[:issue] && params[:issue][:tracker_id]) || params[:tracker_id] || :first)\r\n+    if project.enabled_modules.where(:name => "tracker_permissions").count == 1\r\n+      tracker_list = @project.trackers.select { |t| User.current.allowed_to?("create_tracker#{t.id}".to_sym, @project, :global => true) }\r\n+    else\r\n+      tracker_list = @project.trackers\r\n+    end\r\n+    @issue.tracker ||= tracker_list.find((params[:issue] && params[:issue][:tracker_id]) || params[:tracker_id] || :first)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nIt doesn\'t sound realistic to enforce a in-house patch to core functionality (be it the Tracker functionality or the Issues functionality) like this, then try to play catch-up with Redmine everytime there is a new version (in addition to the fact the code seems to be about to be refactored and otherwise radically modified).\r\n\r\nThe above is my rationale for why this should not be a separate plug-in or a patch, but a core feature.\r\n\r\nI have the backing of my company for contributing, if there is anything I can do to help implement this in Redmine core.',

        description: 'While starting to use Redmine a lot more, we\'re running into the issue that all the emails come from a single email address, and they all look the same. This is, in a way, exactly as it should be - but it makes it hard to create rules for filtering and organizing such notifications. It would be nice to have some hint about who generated the email.\r\n\r\nI see that GitHub does the same, but with one clever refinement: the email _address_ is the same, but the person\'s name specified with that address is the name of the originator.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to implement this idea in Redmine? One option I can think of is that some special characters in the email field set in the admin pages get replaced when creating a new email. In our case, that would be the username of the person causing the email to be generated: issue creator, wiki editor, forum poster, etc.\r\n\r\nThe resulting email would still appear to come from a single email address, but email apps can then show _who_ in the Redmine setup generated the message.\r\n\r\nSo if the *Emission email address* field on the Email notifications page is set to say "@<<me>> <redmine@example.com>@", then this issue would have generated an issue with as sender "@jcw <redmine@example.com>@". Just enough extra detail for receivers of the email to see who it\'s really from, even though Redmine generated it.',

        description: '*Background/Explanation*\r\n\r\nRedmine is an excellent ticket system, and I think that it\'s gestures toward task and project management make it one of the best (if not the best) open-source, cross-platform project managers available. That said, the task and project management features are still kind of incomplete and glommed on to the polished ticket system. They still feel like prototype features. I\'d like to work on that through plugins, but these would be my first substantive RoR projects and would me time some time to complete. So I\'m submitting this as a feature request, but hope to noodle around on it myself as well.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, a task management application called Remember The Milk (http://www.rememberthemilk.com) implemented a notation system that allowed users to create tasks with a single line of text. A task creation line could look something like this:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nPick up the milk ^tomorrow !priority #tag @location *weekly =30min http://example.com\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nOther task management systems adopted similar systems, many using the same notation that RTM had defined. None of these notations were _required_ to create a task, but danged if creating tasks this way wasn\'t quick and just a little bit fun.\r\n\r\nSmart Add was also very flexible and responsive: It recognized many different abbreviations for dates and times (and didn\'t actually require the "^" character for common date formats), used AJAX autosuggest boxes (to help avoid errors due to misspellings), and provided the ~ notation to turn the interpreter off for a particular task. (See: https://www.rememberthemilk.com/help/?ctx=basics.smartadd.whatis for a more complete explanation.)\r\n\r\n*Proposal*\r\n\r\nSmart Add, boiled down to it\'s essence, is just command line flags made friendlier by the use of common special characters and a set of interpreters for arguments that might exist in several different formats. There are two ways that I would like to implement this in Redmine:\r\n\r\n# Add inline flags and arguments to the API (with custom fields represented as "--field_name" flags), and optionally use this notation when parsing issues submitted by email.\r\n# Add a single-line issue creation field.\r\n\r\nIn the settings for this plugin or feature allow the user to set a default project, date, etc. for each field.\r\n\r\n*Postscript*\r\n\r\nThis is something that I will be noodling around with, but as my first serious RoR project I don\'t expect to be able to implement it well or soon. (Some kind of annotated diagram explaining how Rails pieces together a New Issue page from different files/templates/? would be a big help!)',

        description: 'One-off issue creation is cumbersome when juggling many projects. The current process for adding a single issue is:\r\n\r\n# Go to the projects page (keyboard shortcut to bookmark)\r\n# Click the link for the correct project (sometimes requires searching on the page)\r\n# Click New Issue\r\n# CREATE ISSUE\r\n\r\nThis is fine, and in fact preferable, when creating a series of tasks or tickets on one project. However, this is a lot of clicks for a creating single issue.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to provide a generic New Issue page at https://redmine.host/issues/new where the user selects a project from a drop-down menu? This may seem quite close to the current process of going through the projects page, but it has the following advantages:\r\n\r\n* Can bookmark the New Issue page directly (-2 clicks).\r\n* Can use keyboard in the "Project" entry field to quickly select the appropriate project (slight improvement over searching the projects page)\r\n\r\nAlternately, is there a mod that could add the Project field to all New Issue pages? This would be just as well so long as the user\'s current project is always selected by default.\r\n\r\nWill link to a related and, IMHO, far more interesting feature request that would obviate the need for such a page.',

When you reference this issue from a commit you suddenly have two colums and the comments have 50% of the your monitor\'s width. This behaviour sucks because every code block (with @pre@ tags) in the first few comments becomes unreadable!\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is:\r\n\r\n* Place this associated revisions block above (or below) the comments of an issue.\r\n* Make this block expandable with a little button (like the filters).',

OR;\r\n# Position the "root" of the group at the bottom, rather than the top, of a group. This way all later changes appear to "branch out of" the earliest, but keep their most-recent-first order.\r\n\r\n(I personally prefer the former)\r\n\r\nAdditionally:\r\n\r\n* Perhaps also a nice idea to have the "root" item of each group\'s tree show the actual "root" issue/wiki page/news/etc., rather than the earliest change that day? This could also allow removal of some duplicated information - project name, issue subject, etc.\r\n\r\n* Perhaps another view should be added, for a strictly-chronological activity view (entirely ungrouped; as it used to be)? Since I can see there might be a desire for that - which the current grouping configuration already somewhat disrupts.\r\n\r\nI\'ve attached an image of what I mean, in case my descriptions aren\'t clear enough.',

Therefor it has solved many problems of users and have included many features needed by them. From another point of view Atlassian JIRA is one of the most serious competitors of Redmine. So JIRA is a valuable and big source to learn about useful features of an issue tracker.\r\n\r\nI propose that Redmine should try to cover all and every feature of JIRA, either supporting it in core of Redmine, or through a plugin (set).\r\n\r\nAlso I propose maintaining a wiki page for tracking status of coverage of JIRA features in Redmine. This page should include information about unsupported features, supported features (and the version(s) supporting each) in core, and supported features through plugins introducing the supporting plugin(s) for each feature.\r\n\r\nWe can learn about JIRA features by scanning its "Release Notes":https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Production+Releases.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this issue is actually a meta-issue requesting a meta-feature.',
